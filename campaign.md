## Trahald, the Ash & Obsidian Merchant


Trahald is a halfling with many layers: To most people, he's nothing more than a traveling merchant.
He’s the sort who blends into a crowd, quick with a joke, slow to anger.


Trahald does not look like a man fate would choose. He is short, broad in the shoulders, with skin the gray-brown of volcanic stone and a merchant’s easy smile. He dresses plainly — patched wool, leather shoes, a heavy cloak for travel — and speaks with the practiced politeness of someone who has haggled his way through every market on the plateau.

What sets him apart is not wealth or influence, but persistence. While the plateau of Mithryn is called barren, Trahald has made a modest living from its bones. Along the flanks of Mount Amaroth, where the wind scours gullies and old lava beds, he collects volcanic ash and glass.

The ash, sifted fine, becomes pigment for dye, glaze for pottery, or polish for metalwork.

The obsidian, brittle but sharp, he works into arrowheads, knives, and jewelry.

Though Amaroth has been quiet for millennia, its slopes still yield their secrets. Trahald knows the gullies, the dry riverbeds where volcanic silt collects, and the hidden quarries where shards of black glass lie in heaps. It is hard, dirty labor, but it gives him goods the outside world expects from Mithryn: cheap, simple, unglamorous wares.

## The Caravan

Once a year, when the snows melt, Trahald joins a caravan comming from further south to carry his goods beyond the plateau. He pays his share for a guard and a place in the line of wagons.
The obsidian is his cover. Hidden among the crates and sacks are artifacts of another kind: a shard of glazed pottery, a crystal lamp fragment, a strip of fabric that shimmers like starlight. These he smuggles out piece by piece, tucked between layers of black glass or disguised as trinkets. He tells himself he does it for profit, but there is more: the thrill of keeping alive things the law has tried to erase.

### The Caravan Route:

Ubrath – The great southern port where the caravan assembles. Ships from Harath bring spices, cloth, wine, and ivory. The caravan forms here with protection purchased from southern lords.
The Desert Road – From Ubrath, the caravan pushes northeast into the arid uplands, skirting the southern edge of the Ashen Peaks, a mountain wall marking the border of Mythren.
Pelareth – Once the caravan clears the Ashen Peaks, it descends into the fertile riverlands along the Andurel. Here, the caravan swells with local produce and river traffic. 
The White Hills – The road climbs through green and prosperous Calendor's heartland.
Mintharel – The shining tower-city, Calendor's capital.


The Cave Incident
On one journey, Trahald strayed off the beaten path:
A storm (or pursuit by inquisitors, or bandits) forced him to seek shelter in a cave near Mount Amaroth’s roots.
Inside, he found not emptiness, but a forgotten chamber, likely a remnant of Mithryn’s old terraced underworks.
There, he came across a relic shard — perhaps a crystal or a carved stone linked to the amulet.
Touching it overwhelmed him with a vision:
Flashes of Mithryn’s past — terraces glowing under crystalline lamps, voices singing in unity.
A glimpse of the amulet itself — not its location, but its feeling: a presence in the world, waiting.
The cave’s shadow — a sense of something watching, perhaps the echo of the Grey Vulture’s hunt.
He awoke hours later, half-buried in rubble from a rockfall that had sealed part of the chamber. When he emerged, the shard was gone — or perhaps it dissolved after serving its purpose.
Why He Returned to Mithryn
Though a trader, he no longer felt safe on the open road — his vision convinced him that Mithryn itself was where the truth lies.
He also felt… called back. The vision planted a tugging sense that something vital is about to awaken at home.
He still trades, but more locally now, between the plateau’s towns and villages. He listens for rumors, collects songs, and pays special attention to odd finds surfacing in markets.
What He Knows
Trahald doesn’t know the full truth, but he remembers the feeling of the vision.
He can describe snatches of imagery:
“A mountain of gardens, climbing against the sky.”
“Hands of every color clasped together, singing one song.”
“A light that was not fire, brighter than any sun.”
He sometimes dreams of the amulet’s heartbeat-like thrum, though he’s never seen it again.
Why He Matters
Trahald is the Everyman who carries a key memory.
His vision didn’t make him chosen, but it placed him in the web of the amulet’s awakening.
He’s believable: people know him as a trader, not a mystic. That makes his testimony both easier to dismiss and harder to disprove.
To the Grey Vulture’s agents, he is dangerous precisely because he’s ordinary — a voice that others might trust.

## Locations:

### Thalan Caras — The Root Prison
Location & Appearance
Setting: Deep in the northern elven forests, built where several colossal trees grow so close their root systems have fused into a natural fortress.
Architecture: The prison is not “built” in the human sense. Its cells are hollowed from the living roots themselves, shaped and hardened by druidic magic so they remain alive and unyielding. The wood heals if cut, and only elven magic or immense force can open a sealed door.
Light & Atmosphere: Dim light filters down from the canopy through moss-choked slits. In the prison’s depths, bioluminescent fungi provide eerie green-blue illumination. The air smells of earth, sap, and damp moss.
Symbolism: To the elves, the place represents justice intertwined with the living forest. To prisoners, it is a place where the roots grow around you — and will never let go.
Access to Thalan Caras
There is no single “main entrance,” and each approach has its own risks.
The Forest Road (Official Route)
A narrow, patrolled road leading to the front gates.
Challenges: Checkpoints every 200–300 paces, mounted scouts, and magical warding to detect concealed weapons or artifacts.
The River of Sighs (Smuggler’s Route)
A slow, winding river that disappears beneath the roots before surfacing within the prison’s lower cisterns.
Challenges: Treacherous currents, waterlogged roots blocking the way, giant freshwater eels, risk of drowning.
The Canopy Path (Elven Messenger Route)
A high rope-and-branch walkway connecting outposts above the prison.
Challenges: Requires climbing skill, extreme heights, and avoiding hawk-riders and sentries who patrol from above.
The Hollowed Root Tunnel (Forgotten Entrance)
An overgrown tunnel leading to a collapsed section of an old root cell.
Challenges: Collapsed debris, swarms of biting insects, and a druidic seal that may require puzzle-solving, magical insight, or brute force to bypass.
Potential Challenges Before They Even Reach It
Wandering Patrols: Mobile elven scouts may notice outsiders and tail them for hours before acting.
Natural Hazards: Chasms hidden under moss, quickmire (bog that looks like solid ground), or poisonous plants.
Elven Bureaucracy: If they try a legal approach (petitioning for Trahald’s release), they’ll have to navigate elven law, diplomacy, and bribes — all while avoiding giving away the real reason they want him.
Inside Thalan Caras
Cell Layout: Trahald is kept in a mid-level cell, away from both the damp lower cells (used for the most dangerous criminals) and the “honor cells” near the surface (used for political prisoners of status).
Security:
Living root bars (flexible enough for elves to open via magic, rigid to all others).
Guards in rotating pairs; no one stays at one post for more than two hours.
Silent Alarm magic woven into the roots — breaking or damaging a root anywhere in the prison alerts the warden.

NPCs:
Warden Lathandriel — A strict but pragmatic elf who may be bribed with rare books or cultural relics.
Other Prisoners — A human bard jailed for forbidden songs, an orc merchant accused of spying, a deserter from the elven army. These can be allies, distractions, or complications.
Possible Rescue Paths
The Disguised Official: Forge documents, bribe an official, or charm their way in as inspectors or dignitaries — risky if papers are checked against magical archives.
The Smuggler’s Flood: Sneak in via the River of Sighs, free Trahald, and ride the current out — possibly flooding part of the prison as a distraction.
The Inside Job: Get another prisoner released or transferred, who then carries hidden tools or information back inside for the rescue attempt.
The Distraction: Stage a large enough disturbance in the forest (set a fire, lure a monster, instigate a prisoner riot) to draw guards away.
The Bribe: Find what Warden Lathandriel wants most and trade it for Trahald’s freedom — but at the cost of losing a valuable cultural relic or political favor.
The Ambush: Intercept the transfer caravan on the road when Trahald is moved to the high-security facility — avoiding the prison altogether.



### Veyrath Crossing, A bustling border city just outside the occupied zone, rebuilt on the ruins of a small pre-war trade town.


- Appearance: Built along both sides of a deep river gorge, connected by a massive stone bridge of pre-war design (rumored to be dwarven-engineered with Mordor’s science-magics).  
Old architecture shows your people’s precision stonework, but patched with haphazard wood-and-mud extensions from post-war refugees.  

- Tone & Atmosphere: On the surface, it’s bustling and mercantile — traders hawk goods, ferries move people across the river, guards stroll the bridge.
