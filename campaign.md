# Not ready, just a bunch of scattered notes

## Trahald, the Ash & Obsidian Merchant

### Appearance

Trahald is the sort who blends into a crowd, a halfling of gray-brown colored skin of volcanic stone, quick with a joke, slow to anger.  His clothes are patched wool and plain leather, his heavy cloak worn from years of travel. He keeps an easy merchant’s smile, and his voice carries the practiced politeness of someone who has haggled in markets across the plateau. 

### Who He Is

Trahald makes his living where others see only waste.
Along the flanks of Mount Amaroth, he scours gullies and old lava beds, gathering volcanic ash and shards of obsidian. He sells the ash as pigment for dye, glaze for pottery, or polish for metal. The obsidian he knaps into arrowheads, knives, and trinkets.
It is dirty, dangerous labor. Yet from the “barren” plateau, Trahald has coaxed out a modest living, and through persistence alone has built a reputation as a dependable if unremarkable trader.

But beneath the plain wares lie other treasures. Hidden among his crates, smuggled out one piece at a time, are forbidden fragments of Mithryn’s past: a shard of glazed pottery, a lamp crystal, a strip of fabric that shimmers with impossible hues. He tells himself he does this for profit, but the truth is more complicated. He feels the weight of erasure — and thrills at defying it.

### The Caravan

Once each year, when the snows retreat, Trahald joins the great southern caravan. He pays his share for guards and a wagon space, mingling his obsidian and ash among bolts of cloth, spices, and wine. His route winds far beyond Mithryn’s borders:

Ubrath – The great southern port where the caravan assembles. Ships from Harath bring spices, cloth, wine, and ivory. The caravan forms here with protection purchased from southern lords.
The Desert Road – From Ubrath, the caravan pushes northeast into the arid uplands, skirting the southern edge of the Ashen Peaks, a mountain wall marking the border of Mythren.
Pelareth – Once the caravan clears the Ashen Peaks, it descends into the fertile riverlands along the Andurel. Here, the caravan swells with local produce and river traffic. 
The White Hills – The road climbs through green and prosperous Calendor's heartland.
Mintharel – The shining tower-city, Calendor's capital.

### The Cave Incident

One journey changed him forever. Chased off the road by storm or pursuit (the tale shifts each time he tells it), Trahald sought shelter in a cave near Amaroth’s roots.
There, exhaustion overtook him, and he fell into dreams unlike any he had known. He saw terraces lit with crystalline lamps, voices singing in harmony, fields overflowing with impossible fruit. And then — a glimpse, not of a place, but of a presence: the amulet, waiting.

When he woke, half-buried in rubble from a rockfall that sealed part of the cave, the memory lingered. He does not speak of it openly, but since then his smuggling has carried a sharper edge. He is no longer only a trader of ash and stone. He has become a carrier of whispers.

### What He Wants

Trahald tells himself he wants profit — and profit he does find. But what drives him now is harder to name: the compulsion to salvage, to protect, to ferry forward pieces of a story that others demand remain buried. He would deny it if accused, but deep down he feels chosen — not by fate, but by persistence.

### How to Use Him in Play

As a Contact: Trahald is a natural ally for PCs seeking hidden relics, though his caution means he will not reveal everything at once.

As a Smuggler: He can move items or people across borders, blending them in with his obsidian trade.

As a Witness: His dreams of the amulet make him a rare mortal who has felt its presence, though he only understands fragments.



## Tomael of the Hollow Ways

### Appearance

Tomael looks unassuming at first glance: an older man with wild curls the color of autumn straw, skin darkened by sun and time, and eyes that glint like wet stone. His clothes are a patchwork of fabrics no one recognizes — scraps of shimmering weave, vine-dyed cloaks, buttons of carved shell. He is always humming or whistling a tune that no one else seems to know but everyone finds themselves echoing later without meaning to.

### Who He Is

Tomael is older than the war that silenced Mithryn. He was never a king, nor a warrior, nor even a scholar in the city’s universities. He was a wanderer, a poet, a singer of crossroads.
While the lords and armies fought, he simply stayed. He walked the terraces, sang to the seeds, whispered to the rivers. He never raised a weapon. When asked why, he only laughs:

“Steel forgets faster than roots. Roots remember.”

This isn't naivety. It's something more disturbing: Tomael operates on a different timescale. To him, the Council's three-thousand-year occupation is a season — long and harsh, but still just a season. Gardens survive winters. Seeds wait decades to sprout. The earth remembers everything and rushes nothing.

### The Hollow Ways

Tomael lives in the “Hollow Ways” — a stretch of land where paths fold strangely. Travelers who follow his humming may find themselves walking all day only to return to where they began, except something is different: a broken wagon is now whole, a dying man now breathing, a memory thought lost suddenly clear again.
He claims the Hollow Ways are not his to command — they are simply the “echo of Mithryn’s heart,” and he listens where others cannot.
To some, this makes him a trickster. To others, a saint. To all, he is an unsettling reminder that the plateau holds more than it reveals.

### What He Wants

Tomael does not seek power, nor does he hoard knowledge. His goal is simpler, stranger: to remind.
He teaches songs no one remembers learning, rhymes that unlock hidden doors, and nonsense verses that turn out to describe old terraces, old rituals, old names. He plants memory like seeds, one word at a time.
He claims that when people sing together, “the lie thins.”

### How to Use Him in Play

As a Guide: Tomael might appear when the players are lost — not to show them the way, but to help them find it themselves, usually through baffling riddles or songs that only make sense later.

As a Disruptor: His presence disrupts the “accepted” story. He laughs at the Council’s history, mocks the Grey Vulture, and speaks freely of things others have forgotten or forbidden.

As a Mirror: He forces players to consider how much they want to know. Tomael’s truths are never straightforward; he gives fragments that make players question whether uncovering history will bring freedom or danger.

### Hooks

The Forgotten Song: Tomael teaches the party a song that, when sung at a certain ruin, causes ancient machinery to stir awake.

The Vanishing Path: Travelers vanish into the Hollow Ways; Tomael insists they are “walking backward through memory” and can be retrieved — but only if the PCs are willing to risk walking with him.

The Grey Vulture’s Fear: Rumor spreads that Tharuk-Un has placed spies specifically to track Tomael, though no one has ever managed to catch him. Why is the immortal wizard afraid of a singing vagrant?

Additional NPCs
Captain Sareth Stonebinder
Appearance
A tall figure with the bearing of nobility worn down by decades of compromise. Her skin is deep bronze with undertones of copper, hair iron-gray streaked with premature white, cut military-short. Her left hand bears old burn scars she never hides. She wears the blue-and-silver uniform of Calendor's garrison, but her boots are local make — soft leather that knows every stone of Mithryn's paths.
Who She Is
Sareth is Calendor's ranking officer in the plateau, a position she has held for fifteen years. Born in Mithryn to parents who collaborated early with the Council, she was raised on the conqueror's history and trained in their academies. She rose through merit and genuine belief that order brought peace.
But fifteen years of enforcing that order has eroded her certainty. She has burned too many "dangerous" books that contained only recipes. She has arrested grandmothers for humming the wrong tune. Every year, the contradictions multiply: if Mithryn was so evil, why must such effort go into keeping it silent?
The Weight of Command
Sareth enforces the law, but with increasing selectiveness. Artifacts "disappear" from evidence before reaching Mintharel. Prisoners "escape" during transfers. Her reports grow vaguer each season.
She tells herself she maintains stability, prevents bloodshed. In truth, she is buying time — though for what, she cannot say. She feels the awakening in the air and dreads what it might bring: revolution, revelation, or simply the moment she must finally choose a side.
What She Wants
Order without oppression. Truth without chaos. An impossible balance that grows harder to maintain each day. Deep down, she wants someone to give her permission to stop pretending the story makes sense.
How to Use Her in Play
As an Obstacle: She must enforce the law, even against those she privately sympathizes with.
As an Unlikely Ally: If approached carefully, she might "fail" to notice certain activities or provide warnings about raids.
As a Tragic Figure: Her position makes her both powerful and powerless, trapped between duty and conscience.
Hooks
The Missing Report: Sareth deliberately misfiled documents about the PCs. Now inspectors from Mintharel are coming, and she needs help making her lie believable.
The Deserter: One of her soldiers has fled with stolen records. She must retrieve them officially — but might ensure the records "accidentally" reach the right hands.
The Choice: A major artifact has been discovered. Sareth must decide whether to report it or help hide it, and seeks the PCs' counsel.

## Brother Kelamin, the Chronicler

### Appearance

A compact figure wrapped in gray wool and bent from years over manuscripts. His fingers are permanently ink-stained, his hair a wild spray of white around a bald crown. Multiple sets of reading lenses hang from cords around his neck. His eyes — one brown, one green-gold — dart constantly, reading the world like a text.

### Who He Is

Officially, Kelamin serves as monastery librarian in the White Tower, cataloguing approved histories and teaching approved truths. Unofficially, he is the most dangerous criminal in Calendor: a keeper of forbidden memories.
For forty years, he has maintained two libraries. The visible one holds the Council's version of history. The hidden one, concealed in spaces between walls and beneath floors, preserves every fragment of Mithryn's truth he can acquire. He copies banned texts before burning them, memorizes songs before they're silenced, sketches artifacts before they're destroyed.
He learned this calling from his predecessor, who learned from theirs — an unbroken chain of secret chroniclers stretching back to the conquest itself.

### The Hidden Archive

Kelamin's secret library is not one place but many: hollowed books, false floor stones, coded marginalia in approved texts. He has developed a notation system that looks like prayer instructions but contains historical records. To read his archive, one must think like him — patient, paranoid, and utterly committed to preservation.

### What He Wants

To preserve until the time for revelation comes. He doesn't seek to start the awakening — only to ensure that when it arrives, the truth will be ready.

### How to Use Him in Play

As a Knowledge Source: He knows more true history than almost anyone living, though extracting it requires earning deep trust.

As a Quest Giver: He needs rare texts retrieved, artifacts documented, or witnesses interviewed before their memories die.

As a Moral Challenge: His preservation sometimes requires allowing destruction — saving copies while originals burn.

### Hooks

The Dying Scholar: An ancient woman in a distant village remembers pre-conquest songs. Kelamin needs someone to record them before she passes.

The Translation Cipher: He's discovered references to a massive hidden text but needs a lost cipher to decode it.

The Inspection: Investigators are being sent. The PCs must help relocate his entire hidden archive in one night.


## Locations:

### Thalan Caras — The Root Prison

#### Location & Appearance

Setting: Deep in the northern elven forests, built where several colossal trees grow so close their root systems have fused into a natural fortress.

Architecture: The prison is not “built” in the human sense. Its cells are hollowed from the living roots themselves, shaped and hardened by druidic magic so they remain alive and unyielding. The wood heals if cut, and only elven magic or immense force can open a sealed door.

Light & Atmosphere: Dim light filters down from the canopy through moss-choked slits. In the prison’s depths, bioluminescent fungi provide eerie green-blue illumination. The air smells of earth, sap, and damp moss.

Symbolism: To the elves, the place represents justice intertwined with the living forest. To prisoners, it is a place where the roots grow around you — and will never let go.

#### Access to Thalan Caras

There is no single “main entrance,” and each approach has its own risks.

The Forest Road (Official Route)
A narrow, patrolled road leading to the front gates.
Challenges: Checkpoints every 200–300 paces, mounted scouts, and magical warding to detect concealed weapons or artifacts.

The River of Sighs (Smuggler’s Route)
A slow, winding river that disappears beneath the roots before surfacing within the prison’s lower cisterns.
Challenges: Treacherous currents, waterlogged roots blocking the way, giant freshwater eels, risk of drowning.

The Canopy Path (Elven Messenger Route)
A high rope-and-branch walkway connecting outposts above the prison.
Challenges: Requires climbing skill, extreme heights, and avoiding hawk-riders and sentries who patrol from above.

The Hollowed Root Tunnel (Forgotten Entrance)
An overgrown tunnel leading to a collapsed section of an old root cell.
Challenges: Collapsed debris, swarms of biting insects, and a druidic seal that may require puzzle-solving, magical insight, or brute force to bypass.

Potential Challenges Before They Even Reach It
Wandering Patrols: Mobile elven scouts may notice outsiders and tail them for hours before acting.
Natural Hazards: Chasms hidden under moss, quickmire (bog that looks like solid ground), or poisonous plants.
Elven Bureaucracy: If they try a legal approach (petitioning for Trahald’s release), they’ll have to navigate elven law, diplomacy, and bribes — all while avoiding giving away the real reason they want him.

#### Inside Thalan Caras

Cell Layout: Trahald is kept in a mid-level cell, away from both the damp lower cells (used for the most dangerous criminals) and the “honor cells” near the surface (used for political prisoners of status).

Security:
Living root bars (flexible enough for elves to open via magic, rigid to all others).
Guards in rotating pairs; no one stays at one post for more than two hours.
Silent Alarm magic woven into the roots — breaking or damaging a root anywhere in the prison alerts the warden.

#### NPCs:

Warden Lathandriel — A strict but pragmatic elf who may be bribed with rare books or cultural relics.

Other Prisoners — A human bard jailed for forbidden songs, an orc merchant accused of spying, a deserter from the elven army. These can be allies, distractions, or complications.

#### Possible Rescue Paths

The Disguised Official: Forge documents, bribe an official, or charm their way in as inspectors or dignitaries — risky if papers are checked against magical archives.

The Smuggler’s Flood: Sneak in via the River of Sighs, free Trahald, and ride the current out — possibly flooding part of the prison as a distraction.

The Inside Job: Get another prisoner released or transferred, who then carries hidden tools or information back inside for the rescue attempt.

The Distraction: Stage a large enough disturbance in the forest (set a fire, lure a monster, instigate a prisoner riot) to draw guards away.

The Bribe: Find what Warden Lathandriel wants most and trade it for Trahald’s freedom — but at the cost of losing a valuable cultural relic or political favor.

The Ambush: Intercept the transfer caravan on the road when Trahald is moved to the high-security facility — avoiding the prison altogether.



### Veyrath Crossing, A bustling border city just outside the occupied zone, rebuilt on the ruins of a small pre-war trade town.


- Appearance: Built along both sides of a deep river gorge, connected by a massive stone bridge of pre-war design (rumored to be dwarven-engineered with Mordor’s science-magics).  
Old architecture shows your people’s precision stonework, but patched with haphazard wood-and-mud extensions from post-war refugees.  

- Tone & Atmosphere: On the surface, it’s bustling and mercantile — traders hawk goods, ferries move people across the river, guards stroll the bridge.



### The Silent Spire

#### Location & Appearance

Setting: A jagged stump of black stone rises from a windswept plateau, surrounded by a sunken, weed-choked plaza. Outsiders call it the Tyrant’s Throne. To those who live nearby, it is simply the Silent Spire.

Architecture: Once a soaring observatory, only the lowest three levels remain, gutted and hollow. The higher sections were deliberately toppled — massive blocks scattered across the ground, their faces scrubbed smooth to erase the glyphs that once adorned them.

Atmosphere: Birds nest in the crevices, their calls amplified strangely by the hollow stone. At night, the ruin hums faintly, like a shell pressed to the ear. Some say it is only the wind. Others disagree.

Symbolism: To the world, proof of Mithryn’s arrogance: a king’s throne shattered by justice. To those who remember, a wound where knowledge was cut away.

#### What Remains

The Plaza: Its paving stones are cracked, but faint traces of mosaics remain beneath centuries of moss. To a sharp eye, the fragments don’t depict crowns or kings — but constellations.

The Hollow Tower: Inside, the walls bear shallow grooves where massive instruments were pried loose. A few broken mountings remain, their metal slagged. The emptiness feels purposeful — a silence that was engineered.

The Foundation Vaults: Below ground, sealed with rubble, lie storage chambers that the conquerors collapsed rather than haul away. Excavation is possible but perilous; loose stone and stale air threaten explorers.

The Sky Itself: At certain times of year, standing in the Spire’s hollow aligns the visible stars with slits and cracks in the stone. The effect is fleeting, almost accidental — unless you know what to look for.

#### NPCs & Local Presence

Superstitious Farmers: Avoid the Spire, believing crops planted nearby sour quickly. They whisper that the land here “remembers too loudly.”

Relic Hunters: Every decade or so, wanderers dig through the plaza hoping to find a forgotten fragment. Few succeed.

The Moss-keeper: A hermit who tends wild herbs growing among the ruins, convinced they bloom by the stars’ blessing.

#### Adventure Hooks

The Star Map: Aligning the cracks and shadows inside the ruin with the night sky may reveal hidden paths — not with intact instruments, but through the architecture itself, which was designed as a giant calendar.

The Buried Vaults: Clearing the collapsed foundations could reveal sealed chambers with tablets or fragments the Council missed.

The Whispering Silence: At dusk, when the plaza falls utterly still, some claim they hear faint voices in their own language, urging them to look up.

The Vanishing Pilgrim: A villager who camped near the Spire has vanished, leaving only strange patterns traced in the dirt. Retracing their last night may reveal that the Spire is not as inert as it appears.

### Mintharel, Calendor's capital

Setting: Perched on a cliff edge, tiered like a crown of stone, Mintharel is the Council’s proudest fortress.
Architecture: Smooth white stone, rebuilt and repainted endlessly. Every mural and carving that once celebrated Mithryn culture has been sanded flat.

Atmosphere: Blinding sunlight on pale walls, echoing courtyards where even whispers feel overheard.

Symbolism: To the victors, it is “civilization’s beacon.” To Mithryn, it is a city of erasure.

#### Access

- Gate of Oaths: A monumental entry where travelers must swear loyalty to the Council’s “truth.”
- The Sewers: Cracked, foul-smelling tunnels that still carry runoff from the high tiers.
- Mountain Stairs: A goat-path carved into the cliffside, used by smugglers.

#### Secrets & Play Hooks

- In hidden cellars, fragments of banned Mithryn artifacts are catalogued by secret scholars.
- Nobles wear jewelry that incorporates stolen relics.
- A library rumored to hold the Council’s original propaganda drafts, revealing how the story was forged.



### The Petrified Terraces

#### Location & Appearance

Setting: High on Amaroth's western face, where ancient agricultural terraces have been transformed into swept stone shelves. From below, they look like natural rock formations. Up close, the artifice is undeniable.

Architecture: Seven massive terraces, each forty feet high, carved from the living mountain. Stone channels that once carried water now hold only wind. Anchor points for vanished structures dot the surfaces.

Atmosphere: Profound silence broken only by wind. The stone radiates heat during the day, creating shimmering mirages. At night, it releases that warmth, making the terraces oddly comfortable despite the altitude.
Symbolism: The Council claims volcanic activity created these formations. The geometric precision suggests otherwise.

#### The Stone Memory

The terraces weren't destroyed — they were transformed, turned from soil to stone by magic that even the Council's forces didn't fully understand. But transformation isn't destruction. The stone remembers being soil, remembers roots and rain.
During certain conditions — usually involving specific combinations of water, sound, and starlight — patches of stone briefly become soil again. Things planted in these moments of transformation sometimes take root in the stone itself, growing impossible crystal fruits or metal flowers.

#### Hidden Features

The Water Channels: Still functional but sealed. Opening them would require knowledge of the old irrigation systems — and courage to defy the prohibition on "awakening the mountain."

The Seedbank Vault: Rumors speak of a chamber within the terraces where seeds were stored. Finding it would require solving agricultural puzzles no one has thought about for millennia.

The Growing Stones: Certain rocks on the terraces increase in size each year. The Council says it's mineral accumulation. Others suspect the terraces are slowly reversing their petrification.
