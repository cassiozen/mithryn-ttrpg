## Trahald, the Ash & Obsidian Merchant

Trahald does not look like a man fate would choose. He is short, broad in the shoulders, with skin the gray-brown of volcanic stone and a merchant’s easy smile. He dresses plainly — patched wool, leather shoes, a heavy cloak for travel — and speaks with the practiced politeness of someone who has haggled his way through every market on the plateau.

What sets him apart is not wealth or influence, but persistence. While the plateau of Mithryn is called barren, Trahald has made a modest living from its bones. Along the flanks of Mount Amaroth, where the wind scours gullies and old lava beds, he collects volcanic ash and glass.

The ash, sifted fine, becomes pigment for dye, glaze for pottery, or polish for metalwork.

The obsidian, brittle but sharp, he works into arrowheads, knives, and jewelry.

Though Amaroth has been quiet for millennia, its slopes still yield their secrets. Trahald knows the gullies, the dry riverbeds where volcanic silt collects, and the hidden quarries where shards of black glass lie in heaps. It is hard, dirty labor, but it gives him goods the outside world expects from Mithryn: cheap, simple, unglamorous wares.


## The Caravan

Once a year, when the snows melt, Trahald joins a caravan comming from further south to carry his goods beyond the plateau. He pays his share for a guard and a place in the line of wagons.
The obsidian is his cover. Hidden among the crates and sacks are artifacts of another kind: a shard of glazed pottery, a crystal lamp fragment, a strip of fabric that shimmers like starlight. These he smuggles out piece by piece, tucked between layers of black glass or disguised as trinkets. He tells himself he does it for profit, but there is more: the thrill of keeping alive things the law has tried to erase.

### The Caravan Route:

Ubrath – The great southern port where the caravan assembles. Ships from Harath bring spices, cloth, wine, and ivory. The caravan forms here with protection purchased from southern lords.
The Desert Road – From Ubrath, the caravan pushes northeast into the arid uplands, skirting the southern edge of the Ashen Peaks, a mountain wall marking the border of Mythren.
Pelareth – Once the caravan clears the Ashen Peaks, it descends into the fertile riverlands along the Andurel. Here, the caravan swells with local produce and river traffic. 
The White Hills – The road climbs through green and prosperous Calendor's heartland.
Mintharel – The shining tower-city, Calendor's capital.


The Cave Incident
On one journey, Trahald strayed off the beaten path:
A storm (or pursuit by inquisitors, or bandits) forced him to seek shelter in a cave near Mount Amaroth’s roots.
Inside, he found not emptiness, but a forgotten chamber, likely a remnant of Mithryn’s old terraced underworks.
There, he came across a relic shard — perhaps a crystal or a carved stone linked to the amulet.
Touching it overwhelmed him with a vision:
Flashes of Mithryn’s past — terraces glowing under crystalline lamps, voices singing in unity.
A glimpse of the amulet itself — not its location, but its feeling: a presence in the world, waiting.
The cave’s shadow — a sense of something watching, perhaps the echo of the Grey Vulture’s hunt.
He awoke hours later, half-buried in rubble from a rockfall that had sealed part of the chamber. When he emerged, the shard was gone — or perhaps it dissolved after serving its purpose.
Why He Returned to Mithryn
Though a trader, he no longer felt safe on the open road — his vision convinced him that Mithryn itself was where the truth lies.
He also felt… called back. The vision planted a tugging sense that something vital is about to awaken at home.
He still trades, but more locally now, between the plateau’s towns and villages. He listens for rumors, collects songs, and pays special attention to odd finds surfacing in markets.
What He Knows
Trahald doesn’t know the full truth, but he remembers the feeling of the vision.
He can describe snatches of imagery:
“A mountain of gardens, climbing against the sky.”
“Hands of every color clasped together, singing one song.”
“A light that was not fire, brighter than any sun.”
He sometimes dreams of the amulet’s heartbeat-like thrum, though he’s never seen it again.
Why He Matters
Trahald is the Everyman who carries a key memory.
His vision didn’t make him chosen, but it placed him in the web of the amulet’s awakening.
He’s believable: people know him as a trader, not a mystic. That makes his testimony both easier to dismiss and harder to disprove.
To the Grey Vulture’s agents, he is dangerous precisely because he’s ordinary — a voice that others might trust.















## Adventure hook: The Chains of the Grey Vulture


Trahald is a halfling with many layers: To most people, he's nothing more than a traveling merchant.
He’s the sort who blends into a crowd, quick with a joke, slow to anger.
To the party, he’s more than that: a smuggler with a knack for slipping past watchtowers and patrols, a friend who has traded favors, shared drinks, and pulled them out of tight corners. That’s the layer they know best — the resourceful rogue who always has an escape plan.
But beneath that grin and swagger lies a quiet but unwavering loyalty to Mithryn. He risks himself to preserve scraps of its lost culture — an outlawed song carried in his memory, a carved tile tucked into his pack, a forbidden book hidden in a crate of spices. He’s not part of any organization — there is no organization — just a scattered web of people who sometimes hear of each other’s deeds second- or third-hand. For Trahald, each smuggled relic or remembered verse is a defiance against the Silencing.


### The Trouble

On his latest run north, Trahald played the part of the merchant again, bound for the elven markets. 

Trahald had been trading in the borderlands when he met Milo Burrows, a fellow halfling traveler with a reputation for tall tales and improbable luck.

Milo told him what he was after: “There’s an old tunnel in the high mist-cloaked mountains, untouched since before the Silencing. The old songs call it a thieves’ road. Rumor says there’s treasure up there from the Kings of Mithryn themselves.”

Together, they reached the ruins in the mountains — cold, wet caverns where the air tasted of stone dust and history.



At this point, Milo betrayed Trahald. I big hit knocked him unconscious. When he woke up and managed to find his way out, he found all their supplies and ponnies gone.



In his rush to return south, Trahald was injured — a tumble down a rocky gully or a wolf’s bite (you can choose), forcing him to rest near an elven patrol route. That’s when the soldiers found him. They saw only a smuggler far from home with suspicious goods.


### Current Situation

Trahald now sits in Thalan Caras, a prison woven into the roots of massive trees, awaiting transfer to a more secure location. The elves have beaten him for information about smuggling routes, unaware that he carries knowledge that could alter the fate of nations. To them, he’s just another petty criminal with no greater importance.




## Locations:

### Thalan Caras — The Root Prison
Location & Appearance
Setting: Deep in the northern elven forests, built where several colossal trees grow so close their root systems have fused into a natural fortress.
Architecture: The prison is not “built” in the human sense. Its cells are hollowed from the living roots themselves, shaped and hardened by druidic magic so they remain alive and unyielding. The wood heals if cut, and only elven magic or immense force can open a sealed door.
Light & Atmosphere: Dim light filters down from the canopy through moss-choked slits. In the prison’s depths, bioluminescent fungi provide eerie green-blue illumination. The air smells of earth, sap, and damp moss.
Symbolism: To the elves, the place represents justice intertwined with the living forest. To prisoners, it is a place where the roots grow around you — and will never let go.
Access to Thalan Caras
There is no single “main entrance,” and each approach has its own risks.
The Forest Road (Official Route)
A narrow, patrolled road leading to the front gates.
Challenges: Checkpoints every 200–300 paces, mounted scouts, and magical warding to detect concealed weapons or artifacts.
The River of Sighs (Smuggler’s Route)
A slow, winding river that disappears beneath the roots before surfacing within the prison’s lower cisterns.
Challenges: Treacherous currents, waterlogged roots blocking the way, giant freshwater eels, risk of drowning.
The Canopy Path (Elven Messenger Route)
A high rope-and-branch walkway connecting outposts above the prison.
Challenges: Requires climbing skill, extreme heights, and avoiding hawk-riders and sentries who patrol from above.
The Hollowed Root Tunnel (Forgotten Entrance)
An overgrown tunnel leading to a collapsed section of an old root cell.
Challenges: Collapsed debris, swarms of biting insects, and a druidic seal that may require puzzle-solving, magical insight, or brute force to bypass.
Potential Challenges Before They Even Reach It
Territorial Beasts: The elven forest is home to predators — giant owls, moss wolves, and territorial treants.
Wandering Patrols: Mobile elven scouts may notice outsiders and tail them for hours before acting.
Natural Hazards: Chasms hidden under moss, quickmire (bog that looks like solid ground), or poisonous plants.
Elven Bureaucracy: If they try a legal approach (petitioning for Trahald’s release), they’ll have to navigate elven law, diplomacy, and bribes — all while avoiding giving away the real reason they want him.
Inside Thalan Caras
Cell Layout: Trahald is kept in a mid-level cell, away from both the damp lower cells (used for the most dangerous criminals) and the “honor cells” near the surface (used for political prisoners of status).
Security:
Living root bars (flexible enough for elves to open via magic, rigid to all others).
Guards in rotating pairs; no one stays at one post for more than two hours.
Silent Alarm magic woven into the roots — breaking or damaging a root anywhere in the prison alerts the warden.
NPCs:
Warden Lathandriel — A strict but pragmatic elf who may be bribed with rare books or cultural relics.
Other Prisoners — A human bard jailed for forbidden songs, an orc merchant accused of spying, a deserter from the elven army. These can be allies, distractions, or complications.
Possible Rescue Paths
The Disguised Official: Forge documents, bribe an official, or charm their way in as inspectors or dignitaries — risky if papers are checked against magical archives.
The Smuggler’s Flood: Sneak in via the River of Sighs, free Trahald, and ride the current out — possibly flooding part of the prison as a distraction.
The Inside Job: Get another prisoner released or transferred, who then carries hidden tools or information back inside for the rescue attempt.
The Distraction: Stage a large enough disturbance in the forest (set a fire, lure a monster, instigate a prisoner riot) to draw guards away.
The Bribe: Find what Warden Lathandriel wants most and trade it for Trahald’s freedom — but at the cost of losing a valuable cultural relic or political favor.
The Ambush: Intercept the transfer caravan on the road when Trahald is moved to the high-security facility — avoiding the prison altogether.



### Veyrath Crossing, A bustling border city just outside the occupied zone, rebuilt on the ruins of a small pre-war trade town.

- Name origin: derived from “Veyra,” an old Mordor word meaning “to endure,” and “Crossing” because it straddles the only safe pass out of the occupied zone.
- Purpose: Serves as the campaign’s first “hub” — neutral-enough territory that agents, mercenaries, traders, and spies from all factions mix here.
- Appearance: Built along both sides of a deep river gorge, connected by a massive stone bridge of pre-war design (rumored to be dwarven-engineered with Mordor’s science-magics).  
Old architecture shows your people’s precision stonework, but patched with haphazard wood-and-mud extensions from post-war refugees.  

- Tone & Atmosphere: On the surface, it’s bustling and mercantile — traders hawk goods, ferries move people across the river, guards stroll the bridge.
Beneath the surface, there’s an underbelly of political dissent:
Tavern back rooms where old veterans tell stories of the city before it fell.
Smugglers running contraband past enemy patrols.
Scholars collecting scraps of pre-war knowledge.
The anti-Tharuk-Unrhetoric here is cautious:
Not shouted in the square, but over mugs of bitter beer with the shutters closed.
Locals call him “the Grey Vulture” or “Fire-Monger”

#### Rumors and conversations:

True
“Caravans keep vanishing on the Old Forest Road — some say the trees themselves are taking them.”
→ Leads to Great Forest quest (Hook A).
“A river merchant named Iarwain is paying in silver gearwork trinkets for escorts upriver.”
→ Leads to River-Keeper Valley quest (Hook B).
“An old artificer’s been locked up in Imlaril’s tower — the mountain elves say he’s ‘dangerous.’”

Partially True
“Incanus himself was seen on the bridge two nights ago.”
→ Actually an agent wearing a grey cloak, sent to stir fear.
“The Grey Vulture’s searching for a ‘fire jewel’ to crown his staff.”
→ The amulet isn’t a staff ornament, but this rumor plants suspicion.
“The Great Forest is safe now — a caravan came through last week without incident.”
→ That caravan bribed the elves; still dangerous for anyone else.
“Someone in the Archive of Ashes is hiding a pre-war map of the city.”
→ True, but it’s incomplete and possibly booby-trapped with protective runes.


#### Hooks:

Hook A: The Vanishing Caravans
Destination: The Great Forest (Mirkwood).
In-universe premise: Merchants complain that caravans of goods and refugees keep disappearing when taking the old forest road. The missing goods were bound for rebel enclaves in the north.
Tolkien tie-in: Leads to Mirkwood, spider encounters, and the shrine depicting the amulet as a relic of control.

Hook B: The Odd River Merchant
Destination: River-Keeper valley (Tom Bombadil).
In-universe premise: A colorful merchant is looking for armed escorts upriver to his “little patch of paradise.” He claims he can’t pay in coin, but has “something older and truer” that might interest scholars.
Tolkien tie-in: Leads to Tom Bombadil reimagined; the “something older” is a gear-map fragment pointing toward other leads.

Hook C: The Sealed Workshop
Destination: Silver Haven (Rivendell).
In-universe premise: A contact says a master artisan — possibly the last who knows your people’s alloy-forging secrets — is imprisoned in a mountain fortress.
