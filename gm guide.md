# GM Guide

## Principles for GMs

### Trust

- This is not GM versus players. Everyone is here to create a collective story and have fun together.
- Share complete, fair information with players — never trick them by omission.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.
- Build trust by being consistent and honest; once players trust you, they’ll engage deeply.

### Narrative Focus

- The rules exist to support the story, not to constrain it.
- When mechanics slow things down or don’t fit the situation, make a ruling that moves the story forward.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.

### Challenge

- When a player’s approach is sensible and leverages the situation, let it work.
- Ability checks should resolve uncertain, risky actions—but they’re not always needed.
- Always telegraph serious danger clearly; the more deadly, the more obvious.
- Show traps and hazards openly, giving players the chance to think, prepare, and solve.

### Collaboration

- Encourage input from the players about tone, pacing, and stakes.
- Allow players to shape the world through their questions, backstories, and choices.
- Remember: you’re playing too.


## Setting

“History is written by the victors.”

The setting in this game is a reimagining of one of fantasy’s most enduring tales — but from the perspective of the conquered peoples of the east, long branded as monsters by their enemies.

As GM, you might want to conceal the whole truth at first (Players already start with only fragments of Mithryn’s history), then lead them to gradually figure it out. When the moment comes, or if you notice they are already suspecting, a casual name drop can make the revelation strike with tremendous weight.

### The secrets of Mithryn

There was a time when Mithryn was the beating heart of the known world. Standing on a high plateau surrounded by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, the sleeping fire-mountain whose soil was richer than any valley. 
Impossible terraces climbed the mountain’s sides — not gentle, pastoral gardens, but soaring vertical orchards and hanging fields in sheer defiance of gravity, overflowing with fruit, vegetables, and grain. The fruit grown here was famed for its sweetness; vegetables, herbs, and grains were prized across the lands.

Within the city walls, light from crystalline lamps spilled into broad plazas where orators debated beneath flowering trees.

Magic was not hoarded in hidden towers, nor knowledge locked behind guarded gates. Spellwrights sat alongside carpenters in the tea houses, trading charms for better chisels. The universities welcomed anyone with questions to ask. Here, science and magic danced together like lifelong friends.

Mithryn was a land of many peoples, bound not by conquest but by choice. Orcs, halflings, dwarves, elves, men — they wove their bloodlines and cultures into something richer than any one heritage could hold. A living tapestry of union and change.

And then came the silencing.

Clad in humility and speaking the language of caution, the wizard Tharuk-Un (the Grey Vulture) whispered to kings and high lords beyond the plateau. He told them change was dangerous, that the pace of Mithryn’s progress was a threat to the old balances. If left unchecked, it might spread and consume all tradition. Through his counsel, alliances shifted in shadow. The day came when the armies of distant realms — Elves in bright mail, Men bearing the crests of old kingdoms — marched on the city.

This is the truth beneath the lie that the players begin with. The plateau is not poor; its air is not empty. The bloodlines, the strange relics, the half-remembered songs — all are echoes of Mithryn’s forgotten brilliance.

#### The Amulet

In the final months before the siege, when King Nairon could no longer work around the storm gathering beyond the plateau, he called together the finest minds of Mithryn for one last great work. Not a weapon of war — for Mithryn had never believed in such solutions — but a seed of preservation that could not burn.

They conceived something unprecedented: an amulet that would be both vessel and key, library and teacher, memory and promise.
Every master in the city contributed. The scholars etched microscopic runes that held entire treatises. Earthsingers hummed their growth-songs into the metal until it thrummed with life. Astronomers captured the mathematics of the stars in its golden band. Even children were brought to touch it, so it would remember what wonder felt like before the world taught them fear.

The amulet is a knowledge vault. A seed that holds the potential to transform the world anew.

#### The fall

The King of Mithryn fell; the libraries burned. Towers that had taken lifetimes to build toppled in hours. What remained, the conquerors claimed for themselves.

But the amulet survived. When it was torn from King Nairon’s hand, the one who took it was struck with a sudden, shattering realization. Something within the amulet opened the truth of Mithryn to them. In that moment, they turned away from destruction and hid it, sparing it from those who would seek to use or destroy it.

Centuries became millennia. The conquerors’ version of history hardened into stone: Mithryn was a fortress, its king a tyrant, its defeat a liberation. The true story was buried, outlawed, forgotten.
Yet the amulet endures, and it stirs. It has waited three thousand years. It wants to be found.

### The real power of the amulet

The amulet is a vault that contains the knowledge that made Mythyr and its people prosper. Layer upon layer of possibilities that could reshape the world:

It holds practical memories — how to terrace a mountain so it feeds thousands, the way to shape wood, clay, and steel with thought and skill until it becomes poetry. Such knowledge alone could restore Mithryn’s material prosperity.

Deeper, it contains the secrets of the social architecture — the contracts and rituals of trust that let orcs, men, dwarves, halflings, and elves choose cooperation over conquest. These memories could unravel three thousand years of carefully cultivated division.

At its heart, the amulet guards the most luminous truth: that magic belongs to everyone, not as a platitude, but as practical knowledge — the specific words, gestures, and mindsets that awaken the dormant spark in any person. A farmer could learn to sing to crops so they grow healthier and stronger. A carpenter could discover the runes that make wood stronger than steel. The amulet doesn’t grant power; it reminds people they always had it.

To Tharuk-Un, the Grey Vulture, the amulet represents unmaking: a key that would open every locked door he keeps, a voice that would teach every tongue the words he forbids. He hunts it without rest and will do everything in his power to destroy it.


## Tags

Tags are the most flexible part of this game. They define a character’s edge in the fiction and give mechanical weight to the things that make them unique. They also set up complications that keep the story moving. Because tags are open-ended, your role as GM is to help players create tags that are flavorful, balanced, and fun to use.

This section gives you practical tools for guiding players during character creation and ruling on tags during play.

### Facilitating Tag Creation

Players will come to the table with different levels of clarity. Some may have a tag in mind already, others may need prompting. Your job is to help them sharpen vague ideas into usable tools.

#### Start with questions.

Ask: “What do people say about your character?”, “What skill did you learn the hard way?”, or “What trouble always seems to find you?” Questions pull players toward story-rich tags.

#### Encourage flavor before mechanics.

A good tag sounds like something you’d hear in the world: “Curses at cats, but horses obey”, “Debt to a dangerous patron”, “Trained by the River Knights.” The rules will take care of themselves.

#### Check for variety.

Encourage players to spread their three standard tags across different areas — not all stealth, or all social, or all gear. This makes for richer play.

#### For complications, go juicy.

A good complication creates hooks: debts, vows, flaws, curses. If a complication never bites, it’s not doing its job.

#### Judging Tags: What to Allow

Tags are meant to be flexible and player-driven, but you are the final guardrail. Your goal isn’t to limit creativity, but to keep it sharp. A good tag is both a tool for the player and a hook for you to weave into the story.

##### Red Flags

Watch for these common pitfalls:

- Tags that just restate ability scores (“Strong”, “Quick”).
- Tags that apply everywhere (“Lucky”, “Talented”, “Smart”).
- Tags that prevent play (“Never fails at persuasion”).
- Complications that never show up (“Mild fear of bugs”).

##### Say yes, but sharpen.

If a player offers “Smart”, ask: “In what way? Book-smart, streetwise, or sharp-tongued?”

##### Frame as questions.

If you’re unsure about a tag, ask: “When would this apply?” If the player struggles, it needs refining.

##### Reserve the veto, but soften it.

Instead of “no,” say: “That feels a bit too broad. What if we trim it down?”

##### Encourage growth.

Remind players that tags can evolve. It’s fine to start rough and narrow, then reshape/ broaden as the character develops.

#### Complications

Complications are the shadow side of tags. They make characters more interesting, the story more dynamic, and success feel earned. If tags are a spotlight, complications are the dramatic shadows that give the scene depth.

##### Why Complications Matter

- They keep things moving. Complications create friction, forcing choices and drama that simple success can’t.
- They tie characters to the world. A debt, a curse, or a flaw isn’t just personal — it’s a hook for NPCs, factions, and story arcs.
- They make victories feel sweeter. Overcoming a setback has more weight than cruising through unopposed.

A well-designed complication is never just a penalty. It’s an invitation to play.


### Tags in Play

Tags are deliberately flexible. They define what makes a character distinct, but their open wording means the GM must decide when they work during gameplay — both as strengths and as complications. A good ruling on a tag makes the fiction feel sharper, keeps rolls meaningful, and reinforces the unique identity of the character.

#### Tips for Smooth Adjudication

- Use Questions. If a player claims a tag applies but it’s unclear, ask: “What are you doing that shows this?” or “What would others notice about how this helps you here?”

- Reward Good Flavor. When a player makes a vivid case for a tag’s relevance, say yes. If they’re stretching, guide them to narrow or save the tag for when it shines.

- Consistency Builds Trust. Apply the same standard each time. Players should feel that when a tag works, it really matters, and when it doesn’t, the fiction still guides the ruling.

#### Example Adjudications

Ability Check: A player with the tag Circus Performer is trying to climb a crumbling wall. They describe using acrobatic balance to find purchase — the GM rules it applies, lowering the TN by their Rank.

Attack: A PC with Bounty Hunter is fighting an enemy who tries to slip away. The GM allows the tag to apply, counting one of the attack dice as an automatic hit.

#### Putting complications to play

- Keep track of your PCs complications and keep them active. Look for natural opportunities to bring it into play.
- Use complication as spotlight tools. Triggering someone’s complication isn’t about punishing them — it’s about pulling them into the center of the story.

### Awarding New Tags

Tags aren’t only chosen at character creation — they can also be earned in play. When a player does something extraordinary, the story itself can leave a mark on their character sheet.

#### When to Grant a New Tag

Give a player a new tag when three things line up:

- **A Defining Moment**: The action is memorable, dramatic, or consequential for the whole table. It changes how the group sees the character, or how the world will remember them.
- **Narrative creativity and problem-solving**: The player leaned on clever thinking, bold risks, or unique use of resources rather than just numbers on the sheet. This signals that their approach deserves to be codified.
- **Lasting Significance**: The outcome changes the character’s story going forward — either a new strength, a reputation, or even a scar that follows them.

If all three apply, you may award a new tag that captures the essence of what just happened.

#### How to Phrase the Tag

- Keep it grounded in the fiction: “Stared Down the Crimson Duke” instead of “Intimidation”.
- Use the table’s words: if the group is joking that the character “always finds the back door,” that might become the tag.
- Make it clear and situational: the tag should suggest when it applies without being so broad that it could fit anywhere.

#### Example Moments

- A rogue talks down a mob ready to lynch a stranger → gains the tag Voice of the Crowd.
- A fighter leaps from a burning tower with a hostage in their arms, somehow surviving → gains Fallbreaker.
- A healer sacrifices their safety to shield villagers from a monster → gains Guardian of the Helpless.

#### Limits and Balance

Tags are rewards, not participation trophies. A character might earn one every few sessions, or only a handful across a whole campaign.
Don’t overdo it — too many tags dilute their value. When the sheet starts feeling crowded, encourage players to retire or evolve older tags.

#### “Awarding” a complication

Remember that complications can also emerge during gameplay. If the defining moment carried a cost or consequence, make the new tag a complication instead.

##### When to Add a Complication

A complication should be awarded when an action or outcome leaves behind a scar, promise, or twist that will echo forward. Ask yourself:

- Did the moment leave a cost? Even in victory, did the character take on a burden?
- Does it change how the world sees them? Reputation, notoriety, or obligation can stick.
- Will it add tension later? If it creates fun hooks for you as GM, it’s a good complication.

##### Group Complications

Not all complications belong to a single character. Sometimes the fallout of an event is so significant, or the stain on reputation so loud, that it clings to everyone involved. In these moments, you can award a group complication — a tag that sits on every character sheet at the table. Some examples include:

- Shared Guilt or Blame: The party acted together, and the world sees them as one.
- Collective Scar: Everyone was present for a defining moment.
- Ongoing Stakes: The complication will shape how all of their adventures are received, not just one person’s.

##### Tips for awarding a complication:

Be generous but fair. Complications should arise from character choices, not random cruelty.

- Ask for buy-in. When you award one, frame it as: “This feels like it might leave a mark. How about we write it as a complication?”
- Keep them active. A complication that never shows up is wasted ink. Look for natural opportunities to bring it into play.
- Use them as spotlight tools. Triggering someone’s complication isn’t about punishing them — it’s about pulling them into the center of the story.

## Difficulty Modifiers

Not every challenge is equal. Sometimes the task is straightforward, other times it’s complicated by poor conditions, bad timing, or sheer impossibility. By default, a player’s Ability Score and Target Number (TN) already reflect how easy or hard something is for their character. Difficulty Modifiers exist only to make a task harder than usual.

This penalty adds to the Target Number (TN), making it harder to reach.

### Guidelines:

- Use penalties sparingly: Difficulty penalties are there to represent extraordinary obstacles, not to punish normal attempts.
- Narrative first: Always tie the penalty to something in the world the players can see, anticipate, and work around. Telegraph difficulty before they roll.

### Common Difficulty Penalties

- Hard (TN +2): The task is complicated but not extreme.
Examples:
Picking a lock in dim light.
Persuading someone who is distracted or in a hurry.

- Very Hard (TN + 3 / TN + 4): Conditions make success unlikely without preparation.
Examples:
Sneaking past guards in a brightly lit hall.
Scaling a sheer cliff face in a storm.

Impossible: If the fiction makes success literally impossible, don’t ask for a roll. No amount of dice can change that.

## Combat

Combat in this game is designed to be sharp, dangerous, and easy to run. It should move quickly, with high stakes and clear consequences. A few key rules shape how fights unfold:

- **Side Initiative:** After the opening round (where PCs must roll Agility to act), combat alternates by sides. The party acts as a group, then the opponents act as a group. Actions within a side are resolved simultaneously.
- **Attacks Are Simple:** Attacks don’t ask “did I hit?” — instead, damage dice are rolled directly.
- **Reactions:** PCs can act outside of their turn (e.g., to help an ally or interpose themselves). If a player uses a reaction, they begin their next turn with **only one action instead of two**. 


### Tips for Running Combat

- **Keep Track of Reactions.** If a PC takes a Reaction, remember they start their next turn with only one action. 
- **Defense Is Public**. Enemies’ DF is known after the first exchange (or immediately if the GM prefers). Players should always know the number they’re aiming for.
- **Use the Environment.** Give zones descriptive names (*Collapsed Archway, Burning Brazier, Flooded Chamber*). Encourage players to interact with them.
- **Assume characters move and act smartly.** They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks. Don’t surprise the players with gotchas.
- **Offer Surrender.** Enemies can flee, yield, or bargain. Not every fight needs to end in blood. These choices create more story.
