# GM Guide

## Principles for GMs

### Trust

- This is not GM versus players. Everyone is here to create a collective story and have fun together.
- Share complete, fair information with players — never trick them by omission.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.
- Build trust by being consistent and honest; once players trust you, they’ll engage deeply.

### Narrative Focus

- The rules exist to support the story, not to constrain it.
- When mechanics slow things down or don’t fit the situation, make a ruling that moves the story forward.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.
- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.

### Challenge

- When a player’s approach is sensible and leverages the situation, let it work.
- Ability checks should resolve uncertain, risky actions—but they’re not always needed.
- Always telegraph serious danger clearly; the more deadly, the more obvious.
- Show traps and hazards openly, giving players the chance to think, prepare, and solve.

### Collaboration

- Encourage input from the players about tone, pacing, and stakes.
- Allow players to shape the world through their questions, backstories, and choices.
- Remember: you’re playing too.


## Setting

“History is written by the victors.”

The setting in this game is a reimagining of one of fantasy’s most enduring tales — but from the perspective of the conquered peoples of the east, long branded as monsters by their enemies.

As GM, you might want to conceal the whole truth at first (Players already start with only fragments of Mithryn’s history), then lead them to gradually figure it out. When the moment comes, or if you notice they are already suspecting, a casual name drop can make the revelation strike with tremendous weight.

### The secrets of Mithryn

There was a time when Mithryn was the beating heart of the known world. Standing on a high plateau surrounded by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, the sleeping fire-mountain whose soil was richer than any valley. 
Impossible terraces climbed the mountain’s sides — not gentle, pastoral gardens, but soaring vertical orchards and hanging fields in sheer defiance of gravity, overflowing with fruit, vegetables, and grain. The fruit grown here was famed for its sweetness; vegetables, herbs, and grains were prized across the lands.

Within the city walls, light from crystalline lamps spilled into broad plazas where orators debated beneath flowering trees.

Magic was not hoarded in hidden towers, nor knowledge locked behind guarded gates. Spellwrights sat alongside carpenters in the tea houses, trading charms for better chisels. The universities welcomed anyone with questions to ask. Here, science and magic danced together like lifelong friends.

Mithryn was a land of many peoples, bound not by conquest but by choice. Orcs, halflings, dwarves, elves, men — they wove their bloodlines and cultures into something richer than any one heritage could hold. A living tapestry of union and change.

And then came the silencing.

Clad in humility and speaking the language of caution, the wizard Tharuk-Un (the Grey Vulture) whispered to kings and high lords beyond the plateau. He told them change was dangerous, that the pace of Mithryn’s progress was a threat to the old balances. If left unchecked, it might spread and consume all tradition. Through his counsel, alliances shifted in shadow. The day came when the armies of distant realms — Elves in bright mail, Men bearing the crests of old kingdoms — marched on the city.

This is the truth beneath the lie that the players begin with. The plateau is not poor; its air is not empty. The bloodlines, the strange relics, the half-remembered songs — all are echoes of Mithryn’s forgotten brilliance.

#### The Amulet

In the final months before the siege, when King Nairon could no longer work around the storm gathering beyond the plateau, he called together the finest minds of Mithryn for one last great work. Not a weapon of war — for Mithryn had never believed in such solutions — but a seed of preservation that could not burn.

They conceived something unprecedented: an amulet that would be both vessel and key, library and teacher, memory and promise.
Every master in the city contributed. The scholars etched microscopic runes that held entire treatises. Earthsingers hummed their growth-songs into the metal until it thrummed with life. Astronomers captured the mathematics of the stars in its golden band. Even children were brought to touch it, so it would remember what wonder felt like before the world taught them fear.

The amulet is a knowledge vault. A seed that holds the potential to transform the world anew.

#### The fall

The King of Mithryn fell; the libraries burned. Towers that had taken lifetimes to build toppled in hours. What remained, the conquerors claimed for themselves.

But the amulet survived. When it was torn from King Nairon’s hand, the one who took it was struck with a sudden, shattering realization. Something within the amulet opened the truth of Mithryn to them. In that moment, they turned away from destruction and hid it, sparing it from those who would seek to use or destroy it.

Centuries became millennia. The conquerors’ version of history hardened into stone: Mithryn was a fortress, its king a tyrant, its defeat a liberation. The true story was buried, outlawed, forgotten.
Yet the amulet endures, and it stirs. It has waited three thousand years. It wants to be found.

### The real power of the amulet

The amulet is a vault that contains the knowledge that made Mythyr and its people prosper. Layer upon layer of possibilities that could reshape the world:

It holds practical memories — how to terrace a mountain so it feeds thousands, the way to shape wood, clay, and steel with thought and skill until it becomes poetry. Such knowledge alone could restore Mithryn’s material prosperity.

Deeper, it contains the secrets of the social architecture — the contracts and rituals of trust that let orcs, men, dwarves, halflings, and elves choose cooperation over conquest. These memories could unravel three thousand years of carefully cultivated division.

At its heart, the amulet guards the most luminous truth: that magic belongs to everyone, not as a platitude, but as practical knowledge — the specific words, gestures, and mindsets that awaken the dormant spark in any person. A farmer could learn to sing to crops so they grow healthier and stronger. A carpenter could discover the runes that make wood stronger than steel. The amulet doesn’t grant power; it reminds people they always had it.

To Tharuk-Un, the Grey Vulture, the amulet represents unmaking: a key that would open every locked door he keeps, a voice that would teach every tongue the words he forbids. He hunts it without rest and will do everything in his power to destroy it.

## Tags

Tags are the most flexible part of this game. They define what makes characters unique — their edges, flaws, and quirks — and give those traits real weight in the fiction.

Because tags are open-ended, the GM will often need to help players create sharp, flavorful tags and to judge fairly when they apply.


### Facilitating Tag Creation

Players will come to the table with different levels of clarity. Some may have a tag in mind already, others may need prompting. Your role is to help them sharpen vague ideas into usable tools.

#### Ask Questions

Guide players with prompts like:

- “What do people say about your character?”
- “What skill did you learn the hard way?”
- “What trouble always seems to find you?”

#### Encourage flavor before mechanics.

A good tag sounds like something you’d hear in the world: “Curses at cats, but horses obey”, “Debt to a dangerous patron”, “Trained by the River Knights.” The rules will take care of themselves.

Avoid mechanical shorthand like *“Good at persuasion”*.

#### Check for variety

Encourage players to spread their three standard tags across different areas — not all stealth, or all social, or all gear. This makes for richer play.

##### Red Flags

Watch for these common pitfalls:

- Tags that just restate ability scores (“Strong”, “Quick”).
- Tags that apply everywhere (“Lucky”, “Talented”, “Smart”).
- Tags that prevent play (“Never fails at persuasion”).
- Complications that never show up (“Mild fear of bugs”).


When a player comes with a tag that seems too broad or impractical, you can use two techniques: "Yes, but" and "what if":


- Say yes, but sharpen: If a player offers “Smart”, ask: “In what way? Book-smart, streetwise, or sharp-tongued?”
- Instead of “no” say: “That feels a bit too broad. What if we trim it down?”

##### Encourage growth.

Remind players that tags can evolve. It’s fine to start rough and narrow, then reshape/ broaden as the character develops.

### Judging Tags in Play

Tags are intentionally open-ended. That means you must decide when they apply, both as strengths and as complications.

#### Good Rulings

A good ruling on a tag makes the fiction feel sharper, keeps rolls meaningful, and reinforces the unique identity of the character.

#### Tips for Smooth Adjudication

- Use Questions. If a player claims a tag applies but it’s unclear, ask: “What are you doing that shows this?” or “What would others notice about how this helps you here?”

- Reward Good Flavor. When a player makes a vivid case for a tag’s relevance, say yes. If they’re stretching, guide them to narrow or save the tag for when it shines.

- Consistency Builds Trust. Apply the same standard each time. Players should feel that when a tag works, it really matters, and when it doesn’t, the fiction still guides the ruling.

#### Example Adjudications

Ability Check: A player with the tag Circus Performer is trying to climb a crumbling wall. They describe using acrobatic balance to find purchase — the GM rules it applies, lowering the TN by their Rank.

Attack: A PC with Bounty Hunter is fighting an enemy who tries to slip away. The GM allows the tag to apply, counting one of the attack dice as an automatic hit.

### Complications in Play

Complications are the shadow side of tags. They bring friction, spotlight characters, and keep the story dynamic.

#### Why They Matter

- They **add drama**, forcing choices that pure success cannot.  
- They **tie characters to the world**, through debts, reputations, flaws.  
- They **make victories sweeter**, because success came with struggle.  

#### GM Practices

- **Keep Them Active**: Keep track of the PC’s complications and look  for natural opportunities to bring them into play.
- **Spotlight tool**: Use complication as spotlight tools. Triggering someone’s complication isn’t about punishing them — it’s about pulling them into the center of the story.

---

### Awarding New Tags

Tags aren’t fixed at character creation. They can be earned in play. When a player does something extraordinary, the story itself can leave a mark on their character sheet.

#### When to Grant a New Tag

Give a player a new tag when three things line up:

- **A Defining Moment**: The action is memorable, dramatic, or consequential for the whole table. It changes how the group sees the character, or how the world will remember them.
- **Narrative creativity and problem-solving**: The player leaned on clever thinking, bold risks, or unique use of resources rather than just numbers on the sheet. This signals that their approach deserves to be codified.
- **Lasting Significance**: The outcome changes the character’s story going forward — either a new strength, a reputation, or even a scar that follows them.

If all three apply, you may award a new tag that captures the essence of what just happened.

#### How to Phrase It

- Keep it grounded in the fiction: “Stared Down the Crimson Duke” instead of “Intimidation”.
- Use the table’s words: if the group is joking that the character “always finds the back door,” that might become the tag.
- Make it clear and situational: the tag should suggest when it applies without being so broad that it could fit anywhere.

#### Example Moments

- A rogue talks down a mob ready to lynch a stranger → gains the tag Voice of the Crowd.
- A fighter leaps from a burning tower with a hostage in their arms, somehow surviving → gains Fallbreaker.
- A healer sacrifices their safety to shield villagers from a monster → gains Guardian of the Helpless.

#### Limits and Balance

Tags are rewards, not participation trophies. A character might earn one every few sessions, or only a handful across a whole campaign.
Don’t overdo it — too many tags dilute their value. When the sheet starts feeling crowded, encourage players to retire or evolve older tags.

#### “Granting” a complication

New complications can also emerge during gameplay. If the defining moment carried a cost or consequence, make the new tag a complication instead.

Ask yourself:

- Did the moment leave a cost? Even in victory, did the character take on a burden?
- Does it change how the world sees them? Reputation, notoriety, or obligation can stick.
- Will it add tension later?

If yes, shape it into a complication.


##### Group Complications

Not all complications belong to a single character. Sometimes the fallout of an event is so significant, or the stain on reputation so loud, that it clings to everyone involved. In these moments, you can award a group complication — a tag that sits on every character sheet at the table. Some examples include:

- Shared Guilt or Blame: The party acted together, and the world sees them as one.
- Collective Scar: Everyone was present for a defining moment.
- Ongoing Stakes: The complication will shape how all of their adventures are received, not just one person’s.

##### Tips for awarding a complication:

Be generous but fair. Complications should arise from character choices, not random cruelty.

- Ask for buy-in. When you award one, frame it as: “This feels like it might leave a mark. How about we write it as a complication?”
- Keep them active. A complication that never shows up is wasted ink. Look for natural opportunities to bring it into play.
- Use them as spotlight tools. Triggering someone’s complication isn’t about punishing them — it’s about pulling them into the center of the story.

## Difficulty Modifiers

Not every challenge is equal. Sometimes the task is straightforward, other times it’s complicated by poor conditions, bad timing, or sheer impossibility. By default, a player’s Ability Score and Target Number (TN) already reflect how easy or hard something is for their character. Difficulty Modifiers exist only to make a task harder than usual.

This penalty adds to the Target Number (TN), making it harder to reach.

### Guidelines:

- Use penalties sparingly: Difficulty penalties are there to represent extraordinary obstacles, not to punish normal attempts.
- Narrative first: Always tie the penalty to something in the world the players can see, anticipate, and work around. Telegraph difficulty before they roll.

### Common Difficulty Penalties

- Hard (TN +2): The task is complicated but not extreme.
Examples:
Picking a lock in dim light.
Persuading someone who is distracted or in a hurry.

- Very Hard (TN + 3 / TN + 4): Conditions make success unlikely without preparation.
Examples:
Sneaking past guards in a brightly lit hall.
Scaling a sheer cliff face in a storm.

Impossible: If the fiction makes success literally impossible, don’t ask for a roll. No amount of dice can change that.

## Combat

Combat in this game is designed to be quick and dangerous. It should move quickly, with high stakes and clear consequences. A few key rules shape how fights unfold:

- **Side Initiative:** After the opening round (where PCs must roll Agility to act), combat alternates by sides. The party acts as a group, then the opponents act as a group. Actions within a side are resolved simultaneously.
- **Attacks Are Simple:** Attacks don’t ask “did I hit?” — instead, damage dice are rolled directly.
- **Reactions:** PCs can act outside of their turn (e.g., to help an ally or interpose themselves). If a player uses a reaction, they begin their next turn with **only one action instead of two**. 


### Tips for Running Combat

- **Defense Is Public**. Enemies’ DF is known after the first exchange (or immediately if the GM prefers). Players should always know the number they’re aiming for.
- **Use the Environment.** Give zones descriptive names (*Collapsed Archway, Burning Brazier, Flooded Chamber*). Encourage players to interact with them.
- **Assume characters move and act smartly.** They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks. Don’t surprise the players with gotchas.
- **Offer Surrender.** Enemies can flee, yield, or bargain. Not every fight needs to end in blood. These choices create more story. 

### Keeping track of Reactions

It might be worth puting a system or routine in place to keep track of reactions. Here are some ideas:

- Dice Jail: If your group already enjoys putting misbehaving dice in “jail,” lean into it. Whenever a PC takes a reaction, the player should place one of their dice into the jail. After their next turn ends, the jailed die is released.
- Table Signal: Make it social. When a PC take a reaction, have them call out “Next turn: one!”. The group can help keep track, and it becomes part of the rhythm of play.
- Visual Tracker: Write each PC’s name on a notecard, sticky note, or whiteboard. When a PC reacts, mark a token or slash next to their name. After their next turn, clear the mark.


## Magic

Magic in this world is not an outside force nor a gift from the heavens — it is the hidden architecture of the world itself. To practice magic is not to conjure something from nothing, but to recognize and work with what is already present.

A creature well versed in magic can call forth an unbound, ephemeral effects: a shimmer of light, a gust of cool air, a sudden warmth in a dark place, or a brief illusion to distract or delight. These are intentionally fleeting — and will fade quickly.

To make magic endure, though, it must be anchored. For practical purposes, there is no such thing as “pure” spellcasting. There is always a medium — a staff, a ring, a polished stone, a sword, a seed...

### The Role of the Bearer

Magical objects work in a symbiotic relationship with the bearer. Once an object is bound with magic, it only works if the bearer align themselves to the object’s resonance.

This is not always a matter of study; it is a relationship. The object offers, the bearer answers, and together they create power neither could achieve alone.

Someone versed in magic who takes up a well-attuned staff, ring, or blade inherits tremendous power. Their training allows them to meet the object halfway, shaping its resonance into clear, reliable effects.
But even without training, a person can sometimes attune instinctively. A bearer’s courage, need, or conviction can spark resonance. What matters is not knowledge alone, but alignment between object and purpose. 

### What This Means in Play

- Magic is not scarce; it is hidden.
- Magic is not a power characters can study or cast at will. PCs may, however, discover magical items, but they can never simply “be spellcasters.”
- Think of magic as a resource tied to objects and resonance:
  - Objects hold the power.
  - Resonance (the bearer’s alignment to the object’s purpose) determines whether that power can be used.


### How to Use This as GM

- Introduce items sparingly. Each should feel significant, not disposable loot.
- Set attunement triggers. Don’t let items just “switch on.” Require the PC to act in alignment with the item’s nature.
- Reward roleplay. Attunement should click when the player makes a choice that matches the item’s resonance.

### Sample magical objects:

- Stargleam (Sword)
Weapon Stats: Damage 2d12, Rushed Damage 1d12. Requirement: FIN 10+ or STR 10+.
Attunement trigger: Bearer is ready to fight for their convictions.
Effect: Grants +1 automatic hit on their first attack in any combat encounter.

- Shield of the Quiet Watch
A round shield etched with fading runes. When the bearer stands firm to defend others, it grows unyielding — blows that would shatter wood instead strike as if against stone.
Shield Stats: +2 Defense
Attunement trigger: bearer uses Interpose action to protect an ally
Effect: when used with the Interpose action, cancel 3 hits instead of 1 (once per combat).

- The Ashen Helm
Its visor resembles the curve of mountain ridges. When worn, it grants clarity of thought in battle — fear loosens, noise dulls, and the path of action becomes plain.
Attunement trigger: Bearer is ready to fight for their convictions.
Effect: The bearer may automatically act first in the round, without an agility check.

- Opals of Echoed Speech
Two (or more) attuned rings with a cloudy stone set in a plain silver band each. 
Attunement trigger: The bearer reaches to reassure, encourage, or share something of true importance with another, opening themselves in trust.
Bearers may whisper short messages to each other, no matter the distance.

- Ring of Remembrance
A golden ring engraved with vines. When slipped on, it sharpens the bearer's memory.
Attunement trigger: The bearer acts decisively based on knowledge they’ve gained during the campaign (rather than instinct or impulse), proving they carry the past forward with them.
Effect: The wearer gains Advantage on KNO checks when recalling past facts from the campaign.

- Lantern of the Hollow Way
A silver lantern whose flame never dims. Its light does not brighten a room but instead reveals hidden paths — a lost doorframe in ruins, a track across barren stone, a staircase where none seemed to be.
Attunement trigger: Curiosity: the bearer chooses the path of persistence in finding what's hidden
Effect: The lantern grants Advantage on navigation/tracking/investigation check for the bearer.

- Mantle of Grey Feathers
A weathered cloak with pale feathers stitched into its hem. When worn, shadows seem to cling longer around the figure.
Trigger: Bearer chooses stealth over confrontation.
Effect: Grants Advantage on stealth rolls until detected.

- Circlet of the Clear Eye
A thin silver band, almost weightless, engraved with stars.
Trigger: Bearer focuses to perceive what others miss.
Effect: +2 to Insight. This lowers INS TN by 2 for all Insight checks.
