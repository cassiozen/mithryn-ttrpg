# GM Guide

## Principles for GMs

### Information

- Provide useful information about the game world as the characters explore it.
- Players do not need to roll dice to learn about their circumstances.
- Be helpful and direct with your answers to their questions.
- Respond honestly, describe consistently, and always let them know they can keep asking questions.

### Difficulty

- Default to context and realism rather than numbers and mechanics.
- If something the players want to do is sincerely impossible, no roll will allow them to do it.
- Is what the player describes and how they leverage the situation sensible? Let it happen.
- Ability checks cover a great deal of uncertain situations and are often all that is necessary for risky actions.

### Narrative Focus

- Pay attention to the needs and wants of the players, then put realistic opportunities in their path.
- A dagger to your throat will kill you, regardless of your expensive armor and impressive training.

### Danger

- The game world produces real risk of pain and death for the player characters.
- Telegraph serious danger to players when it is present. The more dangerous, the more obvious.
- Put traps in plain sight and let the players take time to figure out a solution.
- Give players opportunities to solve problems and interact with the world.

### Choice

- Give players a solid choice to force outcomes when the situation lulls.
- Work together using this conversational method to keep the game moving.

## Setting

“History is written by the victors”

The setting in this game is a reimagining of one of fantasy’s most enduring tales — but from the perspective of the conquered peoples of the east, long branded as monsters by their enemies.

As GM, you might want to conceal the full truth at first (Players already start with only fragments of Mithryn's history), then lead them to gradually figure it out. When the moment comes, or if you notice they are already suspecting, a casual name drop can make the revelation strike with tremendous weight.

### The secrets of Mithryn

There was a time when Mithryn was the beating heart of the known world. Standing on a high plateau surrounded by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, the sleeping fire-mountain whose soil was richer than any valley. 
Imposible terraces climbed the mountain’s sides — not gentle, pastoral gardens, but soaring vertical orchards and hanging fields in sheer defiance of gravity, overflowing with fruit, vegetables, and grain. The fruit grown here was famed for its sweetness; vegetables, herbs, and grains were prized across the lands.

Within the city walls, light from crystalline lamps spilled into broad plazas where orators debated beneath flowering trees.

Magic was not hoarded in hidden towers, nor knowledge locked behind guarded gates. Spellwrights sat alongside carpenters in the tea houses, trading charms for better chisels. The universities welcomed anyone with questions to ask. Here, science and magic danced together like lifelong friends.

Mithryn was a land of many peoples, bound not by conquest but by choice. Orcs, halflings, dwarves, elves, men — they wove their bloodlines and cultures into something richer than any one heritage could hold. A living tapestry of union and change.

And then came the silencing.

Clad in humility and speaking the language of caution, the wizard Tharuk-Un (the Grey Vulture) whispered to kings and high lords beyond the plateau. He told them change was dangerous, that the pace of Mithryn’s progress was a threat to the old balances. If left unchecked, it might spread and consume all tradition. Through his counsel, alliances shifted in shadow. The day came when the armies of distant realms — Elves in bright mail, Men bearing the crests of old kingdoms — marched on the city.

This is the truth beneath the lie the players begin with. The plateau is not poor; its air is not empty. The bloodlines, the strange relics, the half-remembered songs — all are echoes of Mithryn’s forgotten brilliance.

#### The Amulet

In the final months before the siege, when King Nairon could no longer work around the storm gathering beyond the plateau, he called together the finest minds of Mithryn for one last great work. Not a weapon of war — for Mithryn had never believed in such solutions — but a seed of preservation that could not burn.

They conceived something unprecedented: an amulet that would be both vessel and key, library and teacher, memory and promise.
Every master in the city contributed. The scholars etched microscopic runes that held entire treatises. Earthsingers hummed their growth-songs into the metal until it thrummed with life. Astronomers captured the mathematics of the stars in its golden band. Even children were brought to touch it, so it would remember what wonder felt like before the world taught them fear.

The amulet is a knowledge vault. A seed that holds the potential to transform the world anew.

#### The fall

The King of Mithryn fell; the libraries burned. Towers that had taken lifetimes to build toppled in hours. What remained, the conquerors claimed for themselves.

But the amulet survived. When it was torn from King Nairon’s hand, the one who took it was struck with a sudden, shattering realization. Something within the amulet opened the truth of Mithryn to them. In that moment, they turned away from destruction and hid it, sparing it from those who would seek to use or destroy it.

Centuries became millennia. The conquerors’ version of history hardened into stone: Mithryn was a fortress, its king a tyrant, its defeat a liberation. The true story was buried, outlawed, forgotten.
Yet the amulet endures, and it stirs. It has waited three thousand years. It wants to be found.

### The real power of the amulet

The amulet is a vault that contains the knowledge that made Mythyr and its people prosper. Layer upon layer of possibilities that could reshape the world:

It holds practical memories — how to terrace a mountain so it feeds thousands, the way to shape wood, clay and steel with thought and skill until it becomes poetry. Such knowledge alone could restore Mithryn's material prosperity.

Deeper, it contains the secrets of the social architecture — the contracts and rituals of trust that let orcs, men, dwarves, halflings and elves choose cooperation over conquest. These memories could unravel three thousand years of carefully cultivated division.

At its heart, the amulet guards the most luminous truth: that magic belongs to everyone. Not as a platitude, but as practical knowledge — the specific words, gestures, and mindsets that awaken the dormant spark in any person. A farmer could learn to sing to crops so they grow healthier and stronger. A carpenter could discover the runes that make wood stronger than steel. The amulet doesn't grant power; it reminds people they always had it.

To Tharuk-Un, the Grey Vulture, the amulet represents unmaking: a key that would open every locked door he keeps, a voice that would teach every tongue the words he forbids. He hunts it without rest and will do everything in his power to destroy it.


## Tags

Tags are the most flexible part of this game. They define a character’s edge in the fiction and give mechanical weight to the things that make them unique. They also set up complications that keep the story moving. Because tags are open-ended, your role as GM is to help players create tags that are flavorful, balanced, and fun to use.

This section gives you practical tools for guiding players during character creation and ruling on tags during play.

### Facilitating Tag Creation

Players will come to the table with different levels of clarity. Some may have a tag in mind already, others may need prompting. Your job is to help them sharpen vague ideas into usable tools.

#### Start with questions.

Ask: “What do people say about your character?”, “What skill did you learn the hard way?”, or “What trouble always seems to find you?” Questions pull players toward story-rich tags.

#### Encourage flavor before mechanics.

A good tag sounds like something you’d hear in the world: “Curses at cats, but horses obey”, “Debt to a dangerous patron”, “Trained by the River Knights.” The rules will take care of themselves.

#### Check for variety.

Encourage players to spread their three standard tags across different areas — not all stealth, or all social, or all gear. This makes for richer play.

#### For complications, go juicy.

A good complication creates hooks: debts, vows, flaws, curses. If a complication never bites, it’s not doing its job.

### Judging Tags: What to Allow

Tags are meant to be flexible and player-driven, but you are the final guardrail. Your goal isn’t to limit creativity, but to keep it sharp. A good tag is both a tool for the player and a hook for you to weave into the story.

#### Red Flags

Watch for these common pitfalls:

- Tags that just restate ability scores (“Strong”, “Quick”).
- Tags that apply everywhere (“Lucky”, “Talented”, “Smart”).
- Tags that prevent play (“Never fails at persuasion”).
- Complications that never show up (“Mild fear of bugs”).

#### Say yes, but sharpen.

If a player offers “Smart”, ask: “In what way? Book-smart, streetwise, or sharp-tongued?”

#### Frame as questions.

If you’re unsure about a tag, ask: “When would this apply?” If the player struggles, it needs refining.

#### Reserve the veto, but soften it.

Instead of “no,” say: “That feels a bit too broad. What if we trim it down?”

#### Encourage growth.

Remind players that tags can evolve. It’s fine to start rough narrow and reshape/ broaden as the character develops.

## Dificulty Modifiers

Not every challenge is equal. Sometimes the task is straightforward, other times it’s complicated by poor conditions, bad timing, or sheer impossibility. By default, a player’s Ability Score and Target Number (TN) already reflect how easy or hard something is for their character. Difficulty Modifiers exist only to make a task harder than usual.

This penalty adds to the Target Number (TN), making it harder to reach.

### Guidelines:

- Use penalties sparingly: Difficulty penalties are there to represent extraordinary obstacles, not to punish normal attempts.
- Narrative first: Always tie the penalty to something in the world the players can see, anticipate, and work around. Telegraph difficulty before they roll.

### Common Difficulty Penalties

- Hard (TN +2): The task is complicated but not extreme.
Examples:
Picking a lock in dim light.
Persuading someone who is distracted or in a hurry.

- Moderate Penalty (TN + 3 / TN + 4): Conditions make success unlikely without preparation.
Examples:
Sneaking past guards in a brightly lit hall.
Scaling a sheer cliff face in a storm.

Impossible: If the fiction makes success literally impossible, don’t ask for a roll. No amount of dice can change that.

## Combat

Combat in this game is designed to be sharp, dangerous, and easy to run. It should move quickly, with high stakes and clear consequences. A few key rules shape how fights unfold:

- **Side Initiative:** After the opening round (where PCs must roll Agility to act), combat alternates by sides. The party acts as a group, then the opponents act as a group. Actions within a side are resolved simultaneously.
- **Attacks Are Simple:** Attacks don’t ask “did I hit?” — instead, damage dice are rolled directly.
- **Reactions:** PCs can act outside of their turn (e.g., to help an ally or interpose themselves). If a player uses a reaction, they begin their next turn with **only one action instead of two**. 

### Tips for Running Combat

- **Track Reactions.** If a PC takes a Reaction, remember they start their next turn with only one action. Note it clearly to avoid confusion.  
- **Use the Environment.** Give zones descriptive names (*Collapsed Archway, Burning Brazier, Flooded Chamber*). Encourage players to interact with them.
- **Assume characters move and act smartly.** They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks. Don’t surprise the players with gotchas.
- **Offer Surrender.** Enemies can flee, yield, or bargain. Not every fight needs to end in blood. These choices create more story.
