# Combat rules

## Zones

Combat takes place across zones — loosely defined areas that determine how characters can interact.
Zones aren’t measured in precise feet or meters; they’re an abstraction of position and movement. Here's how a player can interact with a target on:

Same Zone — Within melee reach; PCs can attack with hand-to-hand weapons.
One Zone Apart — Within throwing or ranged weapon range.
Two or Three Zones Apart — Within ranged weapon range.

### GM Tips: 

- Give each zone a descriptive name like Repair Workbench or Collapsed Archway to help players visualize the battlefield. If you have many players or many enemies, you might also find it helpful to write down zone names so everybody can see.

- Assume characters move and act smartly. They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks. Don’t surprise the players with gotchas.

## Rounds

Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. During the first round of combat, each PC must make an agility attribute check in order to act. Exceptional circumstances or feats may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round. Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends.

The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on, until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a character has two actions. An action can be attacking, moving to a neighboring zone, or anything else within reason (grapple, shove, interact with the environment, etc.)

These are all examples of valid actions during a player's turn:

- Move to another neighboring zone and attack
- Move two adjacent zones

### Attacking and Damage

To attack, choose a target and roll the number of dice a weapon grants. Each die that equals or exceeds the target’s To Hit (TH) score deals 1 hit.

### Auto hit and Exploding Dice

Any die showing a 12 is always a hit (regardless of the target's TH). Plus, it may be rolled again for another chance to score a hit. These extra rolls can also explode.

### Double attacks

If the player wants to use both their actions to perform two attacks, resolve the first attack normally. The second attack suffers a penalty: each die must meet or beat TH+2.

## Reactions

Reactions are actions performed out of the player's turn. PCs are free to take a reaction at any time during combat, but they do count as one action: they will start their turn with only 1 action.
The reactions are:

### Interpose

If a creature in the same zone would be struck with an attack, you can push them out of the way and become the new target of the attack.

### Help

Grant an ally automatic hits if the player can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation. The GM may call for an attribute check or grant it automatically, depending on how good the idea is. The GM then determines how many of the ally's weapon dice hit automatically without having to roll.
