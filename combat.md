# Combat rules

## Zones

Combat takes place across zones — loosely defined areas that determine how characters can interact.
Zones aren’t measured in precise feet or meters; they’re an abstraction of position and movement. Here's how a player can interact with a target on:

Same Zone — Within melee reach; PCs can attack with hand-to-hand weapons.
One Zone Apart — Within throwing or ranged weapon range.
Two or Three Zones Apart — Within ranged weapon range.

### GM Tips: 

- Give each zone a descriptive name like Repair Workbench or Collapsed Archway to help players visualize the battlefield. If you have many players or many enemies, you might also find it helpful to write down zone names so everybody can see.

- Assume characters move and act smartly. They will avoid obvious hazards or unneeded opportunity attacks. Don’t surprise the players with gotchas.

## Rounds

Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. During the first round of combat, each PC must make an agility attribute check in order to act. Exceptional circumstances or feats may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round. Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends.

The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on, until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a character may choose one action. This may be attacking, moving to a neighboring zone, or anything else within reason (grapple, shove, interact with the environment, etc.)

## Attacking and Damage

To attack, choose a target and roll the number of dice a weapon grants. Each die that equals or exceeds the target’s To Hit (TH) score deals 1 hit.

### Exploding Dice

Any die showing a 12 may be rolled again for another chance to score a hit. These extra rolls can also explode.


## Dual Weapons

If you attack with two weapons, resolve the first attack normally. The second attack suffers a penalty to its rolls equal to the target’s Rank.
