# Combat rules

Combat in this game is fast, dangerous, and rarely without consequence. Entering a fight means risking wounds, setbacks, or worse, so players should approach it with care. Always weigh alternatives before drawing steel, and ensure you have a fallback plan if things turn bad.

## Zones

Combat takes place across zones — loosely defined areas that determine how characters can interact.
Zones aren’t measured in precise feet or meters; they’re an abstraction of position and movement. Here’s how a player can interact with a target on:

- Same Zone: Within melee reach; PCs can attack with hand-to-hand weapons.
- One Zone Apart: Within throwing or ranged weapon range.
- Two or Three Zones Apart: Within ranged weapon range.

## Rounds

Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. During the first round of combat, each PC must make an agility attribute check in order to act. Exceptional circumstances or feats may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round. Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends.

The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on, until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a character has two actions. An action can be attacking, moving to a neighboring zone, or anything else within reason (grapple, shove, interact with the environment, etc.)

These are all examples of valid actions during a player’s turn:

- Move to another neighboring zone and attack
- Move two adjacent zones
- Attacking twice

### Attacking and Damage

To attack, choose a target and roll the number of dice listed in your weapon’s Damage entry. Dice are not summed up - each die is accounted for separately. Each die that equals or exceeds the target’s Defense (DF) score deals 1 hit.

### Auto hit and Exploding Dice

Any die that rolled its maximum number (a 12 for a d12, for example) is always a hit (regardless of the target’s DF). Plus, it may be rolled again for another chance to score a hit. These extra rolls can also explode.

### Double attacks

If the player wants to use both their actions to perform two attacks, the second attack is considered “rushed”:

- The first attack uses the weapon’s normal Damage dice.
- The second attack is rushed and uses the weapon’s Rushed Damage dice instead.

Players don’t have to resolve each attack in sequence - they can add the number of dice listed in both “Damage” and “Rushed Damage” entries and roll at once.

## Reactions

Reactions are actions performed out of the player’s turn. PCs are free to take a reaction at any time during combat, but they do count as one action: They can only take one reaction on the round, and they will start their next turn with only one action left.
The reactions are:

### Defense

PCs equipped with a shield can react to incoming attacks with a defense to automatically cancel one hit.

Note: A PC must declare that they are defending when the attack is announced, before the roll/result.

### Interpose

If a creature in the same zone would be struck with an attack, you can push it out of the way and become the new target of the attack.

Note: A PC must declare that they are interposing when the attack is announced, before the roll/result.

### Help

Grant an ally automatic hits if the player can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation. The GM may call for an attribute check or grant it automatically, depending on how good the idea is. The GM then determines how many of the ally’s weapon dice hit automatically without having to roll.

## Weapons

Weapons define how you attack: how many dice you roll, what kind of dice, and what you need in order to wield them effectively. Every weapon has three key elements:

### Damage Dice

This is the number and type of dice rolled when you attack.
Dice may be d10, d12, or d20 — larger dice are more swingy but have a greater chance of rolling equal to or above the target’s Defense (DF) score.

### Rushed Damage

Weapons are distinguished not only by how much damage they deal, but also by how well they handle when used in rapid succession. Fast weapons like daggers can be swung again without losing effectiveness, so their Rushed Damage is the same as their normal Damage. Weapons such as short swords and handaxes remain effective but suffer a modest drop in power when used for a second attack in the same turn. 
Heavy, slow, or unwieldy weapons like battleaxes and broadswords strike with devastating force on the first attack but are far less effective when rushed.

### Ability Requirements

Each weapon lists one or more minimum Ability Scores.
If a PC doesn’t meet the requirement, they can still use the weapon, but their attacks will always use the rushed attack dice.
This makes weapon choice a balancing act — you’ll get the best out of weapons that match your character’s abilities.

### Weapon Tags

Many weapons have tags that add tactical variety. Examples:

Bulky: Counts as 2 inventory slots.
Two-handed: Requires both hands free (the PC can’t bear a shield, for example).
Throwable: Can be used at range by hurling.

Besides these commom tags, some weapons can have unique tags (with unique mechanical effects). Check the Equipment section for a full list of weapons. For example, a Rapier has the “Precise” tag, which allows for the bearer to reroll any dice showing 1.

  HP 7, DF 5. Weapon: Dagger (1d10 / 1d10).

- **Sira**
  Tag: Animal Whisperer
  PRE 7, AGI 6, FIN 6.
  HP 6, DF 5. Weapon: Short Sword (2d12 / 1d12).

- **Boris**
  STR 7, AGI 6.
  HP 6, DF 4. Weapon: Longbow (2d10 / 1d12).

### Foes:

- **Brigand Leader** — HP 8, DF 5. Weapon: Short Sword (2d12 / 1d12).
- **Brigand Minion A** — HP 4, DF 5. Weapon: Dagger (1d10 / 1d10).
- **Brigand Minion B** — HP 4, DF 5. Weapon: Dagger (1d10 / 1d10).


The GM declares, “We’re in combat. Zones are: Collapsed Archway (where brigands are), Causeway (where you stand), Rubble Pile (to the side, difficult footing).”

### Round 1 (Opening Round — AGI check to act)

Kael: AGI 6 → TN 14. Rolls 8+5=13 → fail, loses turn.
 GM: “You stumble as the brigands spring out.”
Sira: AGI 6 → TN 14. Rolls 10+9=19 → success.
Boris: AGI 6 → TN 14. Rolls 6+8=14 → success.

#### Player turns

Sira: Moves into Collapsed Archway zone (1 action) and talks to the brigand leader: “No need for blood — we’ve coin.” (1 action) 
GM calls for a Presence check (TN 13, since PRE = 7). Rolls 2d12 = 5+7 = 12 → fail.
GM: “The brigand leader hesitates, eyeing the silver pouch you flash.”

Borin: Moves to the Rubble Pile to flank and shoots from his long bow.
Rolls: 12 (hit+explode) and 7. Rolls explosion die → 11 (another hit). Total of 3 hits.
Total = 3 hits. Minion A HP 4 → 1.
Boris can't make a rushed attack because he already used his two actions for this turn.

#### Enemy turns

Leader attacks Sira (same zone) with Short Sword (2d12). Rolls 10 (hit) and 8 (hit). 
Sira HP 6 → 4.

Minion A (HP 1) stabs Sira with Dagger (1d10). Rolls 6 (hit). Sira HP 4 → 3. She enters Wounded.
GM: “The blade cuts deep. You’re Wounded now — you’ll roll with disadvantage until healed.”

Minion B rushes Kael with Dagger. Rolls 4 (miss).

### Round 2 (PCs then enemies)

#### Player turns

Sira: Tries to command the brigand’s horse tied nearby (Tag: Animal Whisperer).
GM says Presence check (TN 13), and Tag applies (+1 for the roll).

Since she's wounded, she rolls with disadvantage: 3d12=7,5,10 → 12 total → success.

GM: The horse breaks free, running over one of the brigadeers.
There are no splicit rules for damage by animals, but Minion A only had 1 HP left so the GM declares he's down.

Kael: Attacks Leader with Dagger.
Attack 1: d10=10 (auto-hit+explode). Explosion=4 (miss). → 1 hit.
Attack 2 (Rushed 1d10): d10=6 (hit). → 1 hit.
Total: 2 hits. Leader HP 8 → 6.

Boris: Fires at Leader

Attack 1: Longbow 2d10=9 (hit), 5 (hit) → 2 hits.
Attack 2 (Rushed 1d12)=7 (hit) → 1 hit.
Total: 3 hits. . Leader HP 6 → 3.


#### Enemy turns

The GM announces that the Brigand Leader, bloodied but stubborn, tries to finish Sira.
Kael declares Interpose (Reaction).

Leader attacks Kael: 2d12=9,10 → 2 hits. Kael HP 7 → 5.
(Kael will have only 1 action next turn.)

Minion B stabs Kael: d10=3 (miss).

### Round 3

#### Player turns

Kael (only 1 action, due to Interpose): Attacks Leader with Dagger. d10=10 (auto-hit+explode). Explosion=7 (hit). → 2 hits.
Leader HP 3 → 1.

Sira (Wounded → 1 action): Slashes Leader with Short Sword (2d12). Rolls 8 (hit), 2 (miss) → 1 hit.
Leader HP 1 → 0 (down).

As the Leader collapses, the last brigand flees.
