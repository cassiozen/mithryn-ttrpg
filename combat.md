# Combat rules

Combat in this game is fast, dangerous, and rarely without consequence. Entering a fight means risking wounds, setbacks, or worse, so players should approach it with care. Always weigh alternatives before drawing steel, and ensure you have a fallback plan if things turn bad.

## Zones

Combat takes place across zones — loosely defined areas that determine how characters can interact.
Zones aren’t measured in precise feet or meters; they’re an abstraction of position and movement. Here’s how a player can interact with a target on:

- Same Zone: Within melee reach; PCs can attack with hand-to-hand weapons.
- One Zone Apart: Within throwing or ranged weapon range.
- Two or Three Zones Apart: Within ranged weapon range.

## Rounds

Combat is divided into rounds. Each round begins with the player characters, followed by their opponents.
At the start of the first round, each PC must make an Agility check to seize momentum. Exceptional circumstances or special abilities may bypass this requirement.

- Success: You act normally with your full two actions.
- Failure: You still act this round, but with only one action instead of two.

After all PCs have taken their turns, the opponents act, and the round ends.
From the second round onward, turn order continues with all PCs acting first (two actions each unless otherwise limited), then their opponents, and so on until combat ends with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a character has two actions. An action can be attacking, moving to a neighboring zone, or anything else within reason (grapple, shove, interact with the environment, etc.)

These are all examples of valid actions during a player’s turn:

- Move to another neighboring zone and attack
- Move two adjacent zones
- Attacking twice

### Attacking and Damage

To attack, choose a target and roll the number of dice listed in your weapon’s Damage entry. Dice are not summed up - each die is accounted for separately. Each die that equals or exceeds the target’s Defense score score deals 1 hit.

### Auto hit and Exploding Dice

Any die that rolled its maximum number (a 12 for a d12, for example) is always a hit (regardless of the target’s Defense). Plus, it may be rolled again for another chance to score a hit. These extra rolls can also explode.

### Double attacks

If the player wants to use both their actions to perform two attacks, the second attack is considered “rushed”:

- The first attack uses the weapon’s normal Damage dice.
- The second attack is rushed and uses the weapon’s Rushed Damage dice instead.

Players don’t have to resolve each attack in sequence - they can add the number of dice listed in both “Damage” and “Rushed Damage” entries and roll at once.

## Reactions

Reactions are actions performed out of the player’s turn. PCs are free to take a reaction at any time during combat, but they do count as one action: They can only take one reaction on the round, and they will start their next turn with only one action left.
The reactions are:

### Defend

PCs equipped with a shield can react to incoming attacks with the defend action to automatically cancel one hit.

Note: A PC must declare that they are defending when the attack is announced, before the roll/result.

### Interpose

If a creature in the same zone would be struck with an attack, you can push it out of the way and become the new target of the attack.

Note: A PC must declare that they are interposing when the attack is announced, before the roll/result.

### Help

Grant an ally advantage on their attack if the player can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation. 

The GM then can grant let the ally re-roll up to 2 damage dice if they aren't hits.

## Weapons

Weapons define how you attack: how many dice you roll, what kind of dice, and what you need in order to wield them effectively. Every weapon has three key elements:

### Damage Dice

This is the number and type of dice rolled when you attack.
Dice may be d10, d12, or d20 — larger dice are more swingy but have a greater chance of rolling equal to or above the target’s Defense score.

### Rushed Damage

Weapons are distinguished not only by how much damage they deal, but also by how well they handle when used in rapid succession. Fast weapons like daggers can be swung again without losing effectiveness, so their Rushed Damage is the same as their normal Damage. Weapons such as short swords and handaxes remain effective but suffer a modest drop in power when used for a second attack in the same turn.
Heavy, slow, or unwieldy weapons like battleaxes and broadswords strike with devastating force on the first attack but are far less effective when rushed.

### Ability Requirements

Each weapon lists one or more minimum Ability Scores.
If a PC doesn’t meet the requirement, they can still use the weapon, but their attacks will always use the rushed attack dice.
This makes weapon choice a balancing act — you’ll get the best out of weapons that match your character’s abilities.

### Weapon Tags

Many weapons have tags that add tactical variety. Examples:

Two-handed: Requires both hands free (the PC can’t bear a shield, for example).
Throwable: Can be used at range by hurling.

Besides these commom tags, some weapons can have unique tags (with unique mechanical effects). Check the Equipment section for a full list of weapons. For example, a Rapier has the “Precise” tag, which allows for the bearer to reroll any dice showing 1.

  Attack (3d12 → 5, 8 and 12 (explodes); Explosion extra roll 4) → 3 hits. Spearman HP 3→0 (drops).
