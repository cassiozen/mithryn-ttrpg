# Combat rules

## Zones

Combat takes place across zones — loosely defined areas that determine how characters can interact.
Zones aren’t measured in precise feet or meters; they’re an abstraction of position and movement. Here's how a player can interact with a target on:

Same Zone — Within melee reach; PCs can attack with hand-to-hand weapons.
One Zone Apart — Within throwing or ranged weapon range.
Two or Three Zones Apart — Within ranged weapon range.

## Rounds

Each round starts with any PC that is able to act, followed by their opponents. During the first round of combat, each PC must make an agility attribute check in order to act. Exceptional circumstances or feats may negate this requirement. PCs that fail their save lose their turn for this round. Their opponents then take their turn, and the first round ends.

The next round begins with the PCs taking their turn, followed by their opponents, and so on, until combat has ended with one side defeated or fled.

## Actions

On their turn, a character has two actions. An action can be attacking, moving to a neighboring zone, or anything else within reason (grapple, shove, interact with the environment, etc.)

These are all examples of valid actions during a player's turn:

- Move to another neighboring zone and attack
- Move two adjacent zones

### Attacking and Damage

To attack, choose a target and roll the number of dice a weapon grants. Each die that equals or exceeds the target’s To Hit (TH) score deals 1 hit.

### Auto hit and Exploding Dice

Any die showing a 12 is always a hit (regardless of the target's TH). Plus, it may be rolled again for another chance to score a hit. These extra rolls can also explode.

### Double attacks

If the player wants to use both their actions to perform two attacks, resolve the first attack normally. The second attack is considered rushed and suffers a penalty: each die must meet or beat TH+2.

## Reactions

Reactions are actions performed out of the player's turn. PCs are free to take a reaction at any time during combat, but they do count as one action: they will start their turn with only 1 action.
The reactions are:

### Interpose

If a creature in the same zone would be struck with an attack, you can push them out of the way and become the new target of the attack.

### Help

Grant an ally automatic hits if the player can reasonably explain to the GM how you could help in a given situation. The GM may call for an attribute check or grant it automatically, depending on how good the idea is. The GM then determines how many of the ally's weapon dice hit automatically without having to roll. 



## Example Combat Sequence:

Party of 3 PCs:

- Kael (Rank 1, Strength 7, Agility 6, Tag: Streetwise Survivor). HP = 7.
- Sira (Rank 1, Presence 7, Agility 6, Tag: Animal Whisperer). HP = 6. TH = 5.
- Borin (Rank 1, Strength 6, Agility 8, Tag: Battlefield Healer). HP = 6.

They decided to face the brigands in the ruined causeway blocking the passage:

Brigand Leader
HP: 8, TH: 5
Weapon: Sword (2d12)

Brigand Minion
HP: 4, TH: 5
Weapon: Club (1d12)

The GM declares: “We’re in combat. Zones are: Collapsed Archway (where brigands are), Causeway (where you stand), Rubble Pile (to the side, difficult footing).”

### Round 1 (Opening Round — Agility Check to Act)

- Kael (AGI 6 → TN 14). Rolls 2d12 → 8+5 = 13 (fail and looses turn).
  GM: “You stumble as the brigands spring out.”
- Sira (AGI 6 → TN 14). Rolls 10+9 = 19 (success). Acts normally.
- Borin (AGI 8 → TN 12). Rolls 6+8 = 14 (success). Acts normally.

#### Player turns

Sira: Moves into Collapsed Archway zone and tries to talk: “No need for blood — we’ve coin.”  
GM calls for Presence check (TN 13, since PRE = 7). Rolls 2d12 = 5+7 = 12 → fail.
GM: “The brigand leader hesitates, eyeing the silver pouch you flash.”

Borin: Moves to the Rubble Pile to flank and shoots from his long bow (2D12).
Rolls: 12 (hit+explode) and 3. Rolls explosion die → 11 (another hit). Total of 2 hits.

#### Enemy turns

Brigand leader attacks Sira.
Brigand sword: 2d12 against Sira’s TH = 5 (1 Rank + 4 armor)
Rolls: 12 (auto-hit, explodes), then 8 → two hits. Rolls explosion die → 11 (another hit).
Sira takes 3 damage (HP drops from 6 → 3). GM: “The blade cuts deep. You’re Wounded now — you’ll roll with disadvantage until healed.”

### Round 2

Now combat alternates by sides. PCs go first.

#### Player turns

Kael: Charges brigand with dagger (1d12 weapon).
Rolls 1d12 = 12 (auto-hit, explodes). Explosion = 6 (miss). → 1 hit.
Attacks again. Rushed attack with penalty: Rolls 1d12 = 7 (miss).

Sira: Tries to command the brigand’s horse tied nearby (Tag: Animal Whisperer).
GM says Presence check (TN 13), and Tag applies (+1 for the roll).
Rolls 2d12 = 7 and 5, +1 Tag = 13 (Success). Horse and breaks free, running over one of the brigadeers - There are no explicit rule in this case, to GM rules that the brigadeer takes 2 hit and looses his next turn.

Borin: Shoots from his long bow (2D12) at brigand from Rubble zone.
Rolls: 10 (hit), 5 (hit). → 2 hits.
Tries to shoot again with his second action. As a rushed action, he rolls a singe die: 7 (hit)

Enemy brigand drops to 0 HP (down).

#### Enemy turns

The GM announces that the Brigand Leader, bloodied but stubborn, tries to finish Sira.
Kael: Uses reaction Interpose to push Sira away and take the leader’s attack (costs one of his next turn’s actions).
Brigand Leader: Rolls 2d12 = 9 and 10 = both hits (≥5 TH).
Kael takes takes two damage (HP drops from 7 → 5).

#### Round 3

#### Player turns

Sira: Weak, tries short sword shot at leader. Rolls 2d12 = 8 (hit) and 2 (miss) → 1 hit.

Kael: Only has one action this turn, attacks leader with dagger (1d12 weapon).
Rolls 1d12 = 10 → 1 hit.

Borin: Attacks leader again. Rolls 2d12 = 12 (hit+explode), 8 (hit). Explosion = 7 (hit). Total 3 hits.
Leader collapses, the last brigand flees.
