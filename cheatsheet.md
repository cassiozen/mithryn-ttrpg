# Rules Cheat Sheet

## Core Mechanics

- **Ability Scores (1–12):** Agility, Strength, Finesse, Insight, Will, Knowledge.
- **Target Number (TN):** `20 – Ability Score`. Lower is better.
- **Ability Check:** Roll 2d12. If total ≥ TN, you succeed. If a relevant Tag applies, **reduce TN by your Rank**.
- **Difficulty modifier:** GM may add or remove **+1 to +4** to TN for unusual obstacles or advantageous circumstances. 
- **Doubles:** If both dice show the same number, it’s an automatic success (low doubles = success w/ cost; 10–12 = critical success). Only roll if success is plausible.

## Tags

- **Tags:** Specific traits (skills, qualities, quirks). When relevant:
  - **Ability Check:** Reduce TN by Rank.
  - **Attack Roll:** One damage die automatically counts as a hit.
- **Complications:** Negative tags. Mostly narrative, but when relevant, increase TN by Rank.

## Combat

- **Zones:** Same (melee), 1 zone (throwing / short ranged), 2–3 zones (ranged).
- **Rounds:** PCs act first (after initial AGI check: fail = 1 action instead of 2). Then enemies. Repeat.
- **Actions:** 2 per turn (attack, move, attempt, interact). Rushed attack = second action attack with weapon’s “Rushed Damage.”
- **Attacks:** Roll weapon’s damage dice. Each die ≥ enemy’s Defense = 1 hit. Dice at max value = auto-hit and explode (reroll).
- **Defense:** Rank + Armor bonus.
- **Reactions (cost 1 next-turn action):**
  - **Defense (shield):** Cancel 1 hit.
  - **Interpose:** Take a hit meant for an ally in same zone.
  - **Help:** If justified, give advantage to ally’s next attack.
