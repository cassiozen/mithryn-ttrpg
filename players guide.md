# Player’s Guide

## Principles for Players

### Agency

- Attributes and related ability checks do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don’t ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork

- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration

- Asking questions and listening to details is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution

- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning

- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

## Character Creation Guide

### Step 1 - Name and heritage traits

For your character, the real history of Mithryn is yet to be uncovered, but as a player, you can know that this is a land where differences were welcomed and celebrated. Over generations, a tapestry of cultures, features, and traditions was woven so tightly that notions like “pure” bloodlines or rigid racial divisions are now meaningless. Love and marriage happen without regard to skin color, stature, or whether your ears are round or pointy, your feet are cloaked in hair, or your beard refuses to be tamed.

If you were born here, your ancestry is shared — Your appearance may echo one heritage more than another, but your bloodline belongs to all.

For your character, this means you don’t choose a heritage like “elf” or “dwarf.” Instead, you simply describe the traits that matter to you — the features others might notice first, or that you feel define you.

#### Traits to Consider:

- **Stature** — From 1.30m to 2m tall, from compact and sturdy to long-limbed and willowy
- **Build** — Broad-shouldered and powerful, lean and quick, or anywhere in between
- **Ear Shape** — Rounded, pointed, leaf-shaped, slightly drooped, or any blend
- **Skin Tone** — From the palest white to the deepest black, and then further into undertones and hues: bronze, copper, rose, ash, and the greens of olive and soft moss; freckles or patterns may occur
- **Hair** — Straight, wavy, curly, coiled, or braided in texture; colors range from black, brown, and blond to red, silver, or uncommon shades like moss green, blue, and violet
- **Eyes** — Almond, round, or narrow in shape; colors from common browns and blues to gold-flecked hazel, leaf-green, or jewel-bright amber
- **Other Features** — Birthmarks, tusks, or other distinctive characteristics

Write down your character’s name and traits at the top of your character sheet.

### Step 2 - Record your character level and Rank

Every character has two core measures of progression:

- **Level** — Your broad measure of experience and growth. Level increases at key story or gameplay milestones, much like in most TTRPGs. Level is essential for long-term development, but it’s not a number you’ll reference often during regular play.
- **Rank** — A measure of your immediate effectiveness as well as your stakes in the adventure.

Starting out: Characters begin at Level 1 with Rank 1. You’ll track both at the top of your character sheet.

> **Note:** While we recommend starting at Level 1, experienced tables may begin at higher levels if the GM and players prefer.

### Step 3 - Assign your Ability Scores

Your character is defined by six Ability Scores — numbers that represent their natural talents and aptitudes. These scores shape how well they perform in challenges, from swinging a sword to persuading a crowd.

There are six Ability Scores: three physical (Agility, Strength, and Finesse) and three mental (Insight, Presence, and Knowledge).

- **Agility** — Speed, nimbleness, quick reactions to danger  
  *Examples: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver*
- **Strength** — Raw power, toughness, grit, and stamina  
  *Examples: Lift, Smash, Grapple*
- **Finesse** — Precision, accuracy, and delicate or stealthy work  
  *Examples: Control, Hide, Tinker*
- **Insight** — Intuition, the ability to read people and environments  
  *Examples: Perceive, Sense, Navigate*
- **Presence** — Force of personality, confidence, persuasion, social command  
  *Examples: Charm, Perform, Deceive*
- **Knowledge** — Education, reasoning, and comprehension.
  *Examples: Recall, Analyze*

Ability scores range from 1 to 12 (or more, for legendary creatures). For reference, most healthy adult humans have scores in the 2-10 range.

Scores at the extremes are evident to those around you:
At the low end (2 or 1), others might see you as sluggish, always a half-step behind (AGI); looking as though a stiff wind could knock you over (STR); fumbling with tools and knocking things over when you meant to be careful (FIN); missing the obvious or trusting the wrong person at the worst time (INS); speaking in a way that fails to hold attention, your presence fading soon after (PRE); or staring at a simple map as if it’s written in a foreign tongue (KNO).
At the high end (11 or 12), you might be seen as impossibly quick, always in the right place before anyone else reacts (AGI); built like a fortress wall (STR); deft and sure-handed, as if you could thread a needle in the dark (FIN); uncanny in how you read people and places, spotting what no one else notices (INS); magnetic in presence, drawing eyes and commanding attention without effort (PRE); or a well of knowledge, recalling facts and connections effortlesly (KNO).

To assign your ability scores, distribute the following numbers between your attributes:  5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 10. Then, write them down on your character sheet.

#### Calculate the Target Numbers (TNs)

Whenever you try something risky, dramatic, or simply difficult within the game, you’ll roll the dice to see if your character pulls it off.

The Target Number (TN) is the threshold you need to meet or beat with your roll for your action to succeed.

A low TN means your character is skilled in that area — it’ll be easier to succeed.

A high TN means your character struggles in that area — it’ll be harder to succeed.

##### How to Find Each TN

Every Ability Score has its own TN. To figure it out:

- Take the Ability Score.
- Subtract it from 20.
- The result is the TN for that ability.

Example: If your Strength is 7, then your TN for Strength-based rolls is 13 — you’ll succeed whenever your roll is 13 or higher.

### Step 4: Choose Your Tags

Tags are short, specific phrases that define your character in both story and mechanics. They expand on your core abilities, giving them flavor and highlighting both what you excel at and what might get you into trouble.

A tag could describe a skill, a knack, a reputation, a connection, or even a quirk. It might be something your character trained for, something they were born with, or something the world has decided about them.

Tags can grow and change over time. They might broaden as your experience deepens, or be replaced when new events reshape who you are.

You start the game with four tags:

- Three standard tags — advantages that can help you in specific situations.
- One complication — a tag that can hinder you or cause trouble.

#### How Tags Work

When a tag is clearly relevant to your action, it gives a bonus to the ability check roll equal to your rank (making success easier).

Example: Ariad has Rank 2 and the tag Animal Whisperer. Calming a frightened horse normally calls for a Presence roll with TN 14. She rolls 12, but since her tag applies, she applies +2 to the roll and succeeds.

#### Complications

A complication is just a tag with a twist — it represents a drawback, a vulnerability, or a trouble magnet. This could be a personal flaw, an oath you swore, a debt you owe, or a condition you live with. 
Most of the time, complications have a narrative effect - they give the GM reasons to introduce tension, restrictions, or trouble into the story.

Sometimes, a complication might actively work against you in a roll. When this happens, it increases the Target Number (TN) by your rank level.

#### Choosing Good Tags

There is no list of tags to choose from - you create them freely, but avoid vague, catch-all words like “talented”, “strong”, or “focused” — they can fit too many situations and dilute the game. Instead, pick tags that clearly suggest when and how they apply. If you can picture exactly when it would help (or hurt), you’ve got a good tag.

### Step 5 – Choose Your Equipment

Your equipment defines not only how you fight but also how you defend yourself. At character creation, you’ll choose your starting weapons and armor (plus any other gear you may see fit):

- **Weapons** determine how many dice you roll when attacking. Weapons can have a minimum strength requirement.
- **Armor** helps avoid incoming attacks by increasing your character’s Defense (DF) score, a number that determines how high an attacker must roll for you to take damage (More on DF below).

#### Inventory

Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
For game purposes, each character starts with a Bag, Backpack, or similar that can hold up to six slots. 
Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e., filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 DF (Defense, see below). A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

##### Inventory Slots

Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated.
Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots.
A small bag of coins (up to 100 coins) is petty and does not occupy a slot.

#### Starting Wealth

At character creation, you begin with 50 gold pieces to spend on weapons, armor, and useful tools. Alternatively, you may select one of the Starting Kits below:

#### Starting Kits

These packs represent common backgrounds and loadouts for adventurers in this world. You may adjust small details (swap a dagger for a handaxe, rope for chain, etc.) with GM approval.

- **Knight Errant** – Wandering champion sworn to a cause
  Broadsword (Bulky): Min STR 9, Damage 3d12 (Rushed 1d10), Bulky, Two-handed
  Shield: +1 DF
  Chainmail: +5 DF
  Lantern & 3 flasks of oil
  10 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 9 STR to wield the broadsword. AGI or FIN can be lower — this kit leans on raw toughness and presence.

- **Warden of the Wilds** – Ranger, scout, and protector of the borderlands
  Longbow: Min STR 7 + AGI 6, Damage 1d20 (Rushed 1d12), Bulky, Ranged
  Hunting Knife: Min FIN 4, Damage 1d10
  Padded Leather Armor: +4 DF
  Rope (50 ft)
  Snare kit
  15 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: To use the longbow, you must assign 7 STR and 6 AGI. This makes the kit best for balanced builds rather than extremes.

- **Streetwise Rogue** – Quick-handed trickster
  Rapier: Min FIN 7, Damage 2d12 (Rushed 1d12), Precise
  Dagger: Min FIN 4, Damage 1d10 (Throwable, Concealable)
  Padded Leather Armor: +4 DF
  Thieves’ tools
  Lockpicks (bundle)
  20 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 7 FIN to wield the rapier. STR can be lower; prioritize AGI or INS for survivability and cunning.

- **Mercenary Veteran** – Hardened fighter
  Battleaxe: Min STR 9, Damage 3d12 (Rushed 1d10), Bulky, Two-handed, Brutal
  Shortbow: Min AGI 6, Damage 1d12 (Rushed 1d10), Ranged
  Plate armor: +6 DF, Bulky
  Whetstone & repair kit
  5 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 8 STR to wield the battleaxe and 6 AGI for the shortbow. This kit pushes you to cover both physical extremes.

- **Healer** – Wandering cleric or monk devoted to aiding
  Mace: Min STR 5, Damage 2d12 (Rushed 1d10), Two-handed, Magical focus
  Chain Mail: +5 DF
  Healer’s kit (3 uses)
  15 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 5 STR to wield the mace. This kit suits thoughtful characters with lower STR/AGI but strong Knowledge and Presence.


### Step 6 – Your Vital Stats: Hit Points and Defense (DF) score

#### Defense (DF) score

DF reflects the character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. When someone swings at you, they’ll need to roll equal to or higher than your DF to land a hit.

To calculate your DF, add your Rank to the total DF bonus from your armor.

#### Hit Points (HP)

HP represents your ability to keep going despite damage.

Your starting HP is either equal to 6 or to your STRENGTH score - whichever is bigger.

In the character sheet, your HP is represented as boxes that you tick as you get hit. Notice that it already has 6 fully drawn boxes spread across three regions: normal, wounded, and critical. You will learn more about what they mean in the rules section; for now, simply draw extra boxes in the empty spaces to the left until you match your total HP.

## Leveling Up

Your character levels up whenever the GM decides you’ve reached a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions).

There are a total of 10 PC levels divided into 4 ranks:
→ Rank 1 encompasses levels 1-2.
→ Rank 2 encompasses levels 3–5.
→ Rank 3 encompasses levels 6–8.
→ Rank 4 encompasses levels 9–10.

For every level increase, choose to increase either one of your ability scores or your hit points by 1.

If you choose to increase an ability, update that score in the character sheet (don’t forget to update that ability’s TN as well).

If you choose to add a 1 Hit Point slot: Darken the outline of the next rectangle to the left in the Hit Point section of your character sheet.

Every time you reach a new rank:

- Gain one more inventory slot
- Add a new Tag to your character or broaden an existing one.
- Update your DF (Defense): new Rank + DF bonus from your armor.
