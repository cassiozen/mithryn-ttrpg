# Player’s Guide

## Principles for Players

### Agency

- Attributes and related ability checks do not define your character. They are tools.
- Don’t ask only what your character would do, ask what you would do, too.
- Be creative with your intuition, items, and connections.

### Teamwork

- Seek consensus from the other players before barreling forward.
- Stay on the same page about goals and limits, respecting each other and accomplishing more as a group than alone.

### Exploration

- Asking questions and listening to details is more useful than any stats, items, or skills you have.
- Take the GM’s description without suspicion, but don’t shy away from seeking more information.
- There is no single correct way forward.

### Talking

- Treat NPCs as if they were real people, and rely on your curiosity to safely gain information and solve problems.
- You’ll find that most people are interesting and will want to talk things through before getting violent.

### Caution

- Fighting is a choice and rarely a wise one; consider whether violence is the best way to achieve your goals.
- Try to stack the odds in your favor and retreat when things seem unfavorable.

### Planning

- Think of ways to avoid your obstacles through reconnaissance, subtlety, and fact-finding.
- Do some research and ask around about your objectives.

## Setting

The land of Mithryn rises on a plateau ringed by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, a fire-mountain long fallen quiet. Ask the scribes of distant courts, and they will tell you the story is plain: once, an evil, tyrant king ruled here. In the first year of this era, the High Council brought their armies, toppled his rule, and delivered freedom.

That is the tale the world accepts. A simple story. A closed book.

Yet life in Mithryn has never tasted of freedom. For generations, our roads have been watched, the markets searched, the wrong word punished. Most folk keep their heads down and their voices low.

The world looked away, told there was nothing here to see: Mithryn was a plateau of poor soil and poorer fortunes,  notable only for the evil it once harbored.

But the plateau whispers otherwise.

The people themselves carry that mystery. Elsewhere, bloodlines are guarded and categorized — dwarf and elf, man and halfling. Here, such words mean little. It’s in the faces that pass on the street: Eyes shaped like no two others. Ears that taper subtly or curl in curious arcs. Skin runs the whole span from the palest white to the deepest black, and then further into undertones and hues: bronze, copper, rose, the greens of olive and soft moss.
No one is entirely one thing, yet each bears a look that marks them as from this plateau.

And then there are the things that shouldn’t exist, yet sometimes do.

A shard of pottery with a painting and glaze unlike anything made today. A fragment of fabric that seems to shimmer in ways dye cannot explain... Such items are rare — and dangerous. The law demands they be surrendered; to keep one is a capital crime. Yet they are hidden — in false walls, beneath floorboards, inside bread ovens gone cold. Because everyone feels it: they are pieces of something greater, something that does not match the story we’ve been told.

Nearly three millennia have passed since the Council’s war. The world no longer spares Mithryn a thought: their soldiers no longer march here; their interest in this place has waned.

And in that quiet, something has begun to stir.

It is not spoken of, yet it is everywhere — It shows in the songs hummed on the walk home that no one quite remembers learning. In the sudden warmth of the sun breaking through a long, grey sky. In the feeling that the air itself carries a promise.
No one names it, but all can feel it. Something is awakening.
And with it, hope.

### What This Game Is About

As players in Mithryn, you are stepping into a land full of contradictions. The world says it is barren and broken, but everywhere you look, there are signs of something more profound: fragments of beauty, echoes of brilliance, and mysteries that don’t fit the stories you’ve been told.

The central themes you’ll explore are:

#### Lost History

Much of what you see around you doesn’t add up. Your journey is as much about uncovering the forgotten truth as it is about deciding what should come next.

#### Control and Freedom

This is a land where history was erased and silence has been enforced for generations, but where people still find ways to resist — through quiet defiance, whispered stories, or simply surviving. You’ll face questions about power: who holds it, how it is maintained, and what happens when it begins to slip.

#### Awakening

There are forces at play that cannot be fully explained with the knowledge you have — a shimmer in the corner of your eye, a warmth in the air that feels like promise.

As the campaign unfolds, this “awakening” will move from background atmosphere into the heart of your journey. Together, you’ll shape how it unravels — and what kind of future it might bring.

## Character Creation Guide

### Step 1 - Name and heritage traits

For your character, the real history of Mithryn is yet to be uncovered, but as a player, you can know that this is a land where differences were welcomed and celebrated. Over generations, a tapestry of cultures, features, and traditions was woven so tightly that notions like “pure” bloodlines or rigid racial divisions are now meaningless. Love and marriage happen without regard to skin color, stature, or whether your ears are round or pointy, your feet are cloaked in hair, or your beard refuses to be tamed.

If you were born here, your ancestry is shared — Your appearance may echo one heritage more than another, but your bloodline belongs to all.

For your character, this means you don’t choose a heritage like “elf” or “dwarf.” Instead, you simply describe the traits that matter to you — the features others might notice first, or that you feel define you.

#### Traits to Consider:

- **Stature** — From 1.30m to 2m tall, from compact and sturdy to long-limbed and willowy
- **Build** — Broad-shouldered and powerful, lean and quick, or anywhere in between
- **Ear Shape** — Rounded, pointed, leaf-shaped, slightly drooped, or any blend
- **Skin Tone** — From the palest white to the deepest black, and then further into undertones and hues: bronze, copper, rose, ash, and the greens of olive and soft moss; freckles or patterns may occur
- **Hair** — Straight, wavy, curly, coiled, or braided in texture; colors range from black, brown, and blond to red, silver, or uncommon shades like moss green, blue, and violet
- **Eyes** — Almond, round, or narrow in shape; colors from common browns and blues to gold-flecked hazel, leaf-green, or jewel-bright amber
- **Other Features** — Birthmarks, tusks, or other distinctive characteristics

Write down your character’s name and traits at the top of your character sheet.

### Step 2 - Record your character level and Rank

Every character has two core measures of progression:

- **Level** — Your broad measure of experience and growth. Level increases at key story or gameplay milestones, much like in most TTRPGs. Level is essential for long-term development, but it’s not a number you’ll reference often during regular play.
- **Rank** — A measure of your immediate effectiveness as well as your stakes in the adventure.

Starting out: Characters begin at Level 1 with Rank 1. You’ll track both at the top of your character sheet.

> **Note:** While we recommend starting at Level 1, experienced tables may begin at higher levels if the GM and players prefer.

### Step 3 - Assign your Ability Scores

Your character is defined by six Ability Scores — numbers that represent their natural talents and aptitudes. These scores shape how well they perform in challenges, from swinging a sword to persuading a crowd.

There are six Ability Scores: three physical (Agility, Strength, and Finesse) and three mental (Insight, Presence, and Knowledge).

- **Agility** — Speed, nimbleness, quick reactions to danger  
  *Examples: Sprint, Leap, Maneuver*
- **Strength** — Raw power, toughness, grit, and stamina  
  *Examples: Lift, Smash, Grapple*
- **Finesse** — Precision, accuracy, and delicate or stealthy work  
  *Examples: Control, Hide, Tinker*
- **Insight** — Intuition, the ability to read people and environments  
  *Examples: Perceive, Sense, Navigate*
- **Presence** — Force of personality, confidence, persuasion, social command  
  *Examples: Charm, Perform, Deceive*
- **Knowledge** — Education, reasoning, and comprehension.
  *Examples: Recall, Analyze*

Ability scores range from 1 to 12 (or more, for legendary creatures). For reference, most healthy adult humans have scores in the 2-10 range.

Scores at the extremes are evident to those around you:
At the low end (2 or 1), others might see you as sluggish, always a half-step behind (AGI); looking as though a stiff wind could knock you over (STR); fumbling with tools and knocking things over when you meant to be careful (FIN); missing the obvious or trusting the wrong person at the worst time (INS); speaking in a way that fails to hold attention, your presence fading soon after (PRE); or staring at a simple map as if it’s written in a foreign tongue (KNO).
At the high end (11 or 12), you might be seen as impossibly quick, always in the right place before anyone else reacts (AGI); built like a fortress wall (STR); deft and sure-handed, as if you could thread a needle in the dark (FIN); uncanny in how you read people and places, spotting what no one else notices (INS); magnetic in presence, drawing eyes and commanding attention without effort (PRE); or a well of knowledge, recalling facts and connections effortlesly (KNO).

To assign your ability scores, distribute the following numbers between your attributes:  5, 6, 6, 7, 8, 10. Then, write them down on your character sheet.

#### Calculate the Target Numbers (TNs)

Whenever you try something risky, dramatic, or simply difficult within the game, you’ll roll the dice to see if your character pulls it off.

The Target Number (TN) is the threshold you need to meet or beat with your roll for your attempt to succeed.

A low TN means your character is skilled in that area — it’ll be easier to succeed.

A high TN means your character struggles in that area — it’ll be harder to succeed.

##### How to Find Each TN

Every Ability Score has its own TN. To figure it out:

- Take the Ability Score.
- Subtract it from 20.
- The result is the TN for that ability.

Example: If your Strength is 7, then your TN for Strength-based rolls is 13 — you’ll succeed whenever your roll is 13 or higher.

### Step 4: Choose Your Tags

Tags are short, specific phrases that define your character in both story and mechanics. They expand on your core abilities, giving them flavor and highlighting both what you excel at and what might get you into trouble.

A tag could describe a skill, a knack, a reputation, a connection, or even a quirk. It might be something your character trained for, something they were born with, or something the world has decided about them.

Tags can grow and change over time. They might broaden as your experience deepens, or be replaced when new events reshape who you are.

You start the game with four tags:

- Three standard tags — advantages that can help you in specific situations.
- One complication — a tag that can hinder you or cause trouble.

#### How Tags Work

When a tag is clearly relevant to what the PC is attempting, it lowers the target number (TN) of the roll by the PC's rank (making success easier).

Example: Ariad has Rank 2 and the tag Animal Whisperer. Calming a frightened horse normally calls for a Presence roll. Her Presence TN is 14, but since the tag clearly applies, she lowers it to 12. She rolls 12 and succeeds.

#### Complications

A complication is just a tag with a twist — it represents a drawback, a vulnerability, or a trouble magnet. This could be a personal flaw, an oath you swore, a debt you owe, or a condition you live with. 
Most of the time, complications have a narrative effect - they give the GM reasons to introduce tension, restrictions, or trouble into the story.

Sometimes, a complication might actively work against you in a roll. When this happens, it increases the Target Number (TN) by your rank level.

#### Choosing Good Tags

There is no list of tags to choose from - you create them freely, but avoid vague, catch-all words like “talented”, “strong”, or “focused” — they can fit too many situations and dilute the game. Instead, pick tags that clearly suggest when and how they apply. If you can picture exactly when it would help (or hurt), you’ve got a good tag.

### Step 5 – Choose Your Equipment

Your equipment defines not only how you fight but also how you defend yourself. At character creation, you’ll choose your starting weapons and armor (plus any other gear you may see fit):

- **Weapons** determine how many dice you roll when attacking. Weapons can have a minimum strength requirement.
- **Armor** helps avoid incoming attacks by increasing your character’s Defense score, a number that determines how high an attacker must roll for you to take damage (More on Defense below).

#### Inventory

Characters have a total of ten inventory slots, but can only carry four or five items comfortably without the help of bags, backpacks, horses, carts, etc.
For game purposes, each character starts with a Bag, Backpack, or similar that can hold up to six slots. 
Anyone carrying a full inventory (i.e., filling all 10 slots) is reduced to 0 Defense. A character cannot fill more than ten slots.

##### Inventory Slots

Most items take up one slot unless otherwise indicated.
Petty items do not take up any slots. Bulky items take up two slots.
A small bag of coins (up to 100 coins) is petty and does not occupy a slot.

#### Starting Wealth

At character creation, you begin with 50 gold pieces to spend on weapons, armor, and useful tools. Alternatively, you may select one of the Starting Kits below:

#### Starting Kits

These packs represent common backgrounds and loadouts for adventurers in this world. You may adjust small details (swap a dagger for a handaxe, rope for chain, etc.) with GM approval.

- **Knight Errant** – Wandering champion sworn to a cause
  Broadsword (Bulky): Min STR 9, Damage 3d12 (Rushed 1d10), Bulky, Two-handed
  Shield: +1 Defense
  Chainmail: +4 Defense
  Lantern & 3 flasks of oil
  10 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 9 STR to wield the broadsword. AGI or FIN can be lower — this kit leans on raw toughness and presence.

- **Warden of the Wilds** – Ranger, scout, and protector of the borderlands
  Longbow: Min STR 7 + AGI 6, Damage 1d20 (Rushed 1d12), Bulky, Ranged
  Hunting Knife: Min FIN 4, Damage 1d10
  Padded Leather Armor: +3 Defense
  Rope (50 ft)
  Snare kit
  15 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: To use the longbow, you must assign 7 STR and 6 AGI. This makes the kit best for balanced builds rather than extremes.

- **Streetwise Rogue** – Quick-handed trickster
  Rapier: Min FIN 7, Damage 2d12 (Rushed 1d12), Precise
  Dagger: Min FIN 4, Damage 1d10 (Throwable, Concealable)
  Padded Leather Armor: +3 Defense
  Thieves’ tools
  Lockpicks (bundle)
  20 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 7 FIN to wield the rapier. STR can be lower; prioritize AGI or INS for survivability and cunning.

- **Mercenary Veteran** – Hardened fighter
  Battleaxe: Min STR 9, Damage 3d12 (Rushed 1d10), Bulky, Two-handed, Brutal
  Shortbow: Min AGI 6, Damage 1d12 (Rushed 1d10), Ranged
  Plate armor: +5 Defense, Bulky
  Whetstone & repair kit
  5 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 8 STR to wield the battleaxe and 6 AGI for the shortbow. This kit pushes you to cover both physical extremes.

- **Healer** – Wandering cleric or monk devoted to aiding
  Mace: Min STR 5, Damage 2d12 (Rushed 1d10), Two-handed
  Chain Mail: +4 Defense
  Healer’s kit (3 uses)
  15 gold pieces remaining
  Ability Direction: You must assign at least 5 STR to wield the mace. This kit suits thoughtful characters with lower STR/AGI but strong Knowledge and Presence.


### Step 6 – Your Vital Stats: Hit Points and Defense Score

#### Defense score

The Defense score reflects the character’s ability to avoid damage in combat. When someone swings at you, they’ll need to roll equal to or higher than your Defense to land a hit.

To calculate your Defense, add your Rank to the total Defense Bonus from your armor.

#### Hit Points (HP)

HP represents your ability to keep going despite damage.

Your starting HP is either equal to 6 or to your STRENGTH score - whichever is bigger.

In the character sheet, your HP is represented as boxes that you tick as you get hit. Notice that it already has 6 fully drawn boxes spread across three regions: normal, wounded, and critical. You will learn more about what they mean in the rules section; for now, simply draw extra boxes in the empty spaces within the Normal tier until your total HP matches your starting value.

---

## Leveling Up

Your character levels up whenever the GM decides you’ve reached a narrative milestone (usually about every 3 sessions).

There are a total of 10 PC levels divided into 4 ranks:

→ Rank 1 encompasses levels 1-2.
→ Rank 2 encompasses levels 3–5.
→ Rank 3 encompasses levels 6–8.
→ Rank 4 encompasses levels 9–10.

### Gaining a Level

Whenever your character gains a level, choose one of the following benefits:

- +1 Ability Score (and recalculate that Ability’s TN = 20 − new score), or
- +1 Hit Point slot (add another empty box to your HP track), or
- +1 Inventory slot, or
- Broaden a Tag (expand an existing Tag to cover more situations)

### Reaching a New Rank

At Level 3, 6, and 9, you advance into a new Rank. This comes with extra rewards:

First, take note of the new Rank in the character sheet and Update the Defense: Defense = Rank + Armor Bonus

Next, choose one of the following, instead of a normal level-up option:

- Gain a new Tag (a fresh specialty, quality, or talent), or
- Ease a Complication (reduce or resolve one that has burdened you)


### Broadening tags, easing complications

When you broaden a tag, you’re letting it grow with your character’s experiences. A tag that once applied in narrow circumstances can now reach further — but it should still stay flavorful and specific.

- Build on what’s there: Think of situations you’ve actually played through. How has your character’s story stretched this trait?
- Stay concrete: Don’t turn “Locksmith’s Touch” into “Good with everything.” Instead, you might expand it into “Master of Locks and Mechanisms,” reflecting both doors and traps you’ve worked through in play.
- Keep the edge: Broadening doesn’t erase limits. A broadened tag should still feel like it applies strongly in some cases and not at all in others.

Examples: 

- “Animal Whisperer” might broaden to “Beast-Bonded”, after the character learns to handle not just horses and hounds, but also wild or magical creatures.
- “Tracker” might broaden to “Pathfinder”, after the character follows a creature across storm and forest, catching it where others failed.
- “Crowd Charmer” might broaden to “Voice of the Masses,” after the character rallied an entire town square.


When you ease a complication, you’re showing how your character has faced a burden and either learned to manage it or partially resolved it:

- Leave a trace: Complications rarely vanish entirely. Easing doesn’t mean erasing — it means lessening their weight or narrowing their impact.
- Has to be earned: Easing a complication must be justified  to something that happened in play — a choice, sacrifice, or breakthrough.

Examples: 

- “Wanted in Three Cities” might shrink to “Watched in One City,” as the character clears their name in most places but remains under suspicion in their hometown.
- “Debt to a Dangerous Patron” might ease to “Favors Owed,” after the character completes a major task that satisfies most of the patron’s demands.
- “Unlucky with Animals” might ease to “Uneasy Around Beasts,” after the character earns the loyalty of one creature, even if most still shy away.
