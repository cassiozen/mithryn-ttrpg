## System Design Principle

Roleplaying games often get described on a spectrum between “crunchy” (lots of rules, procedures, and bookkeeping) and “narrative” (rules-light, story-first, theater of the mind). That shorthand can be useful, but it’s also limiting. Games can encourage narrative depth in many ways.

The aim of this system, is to allow for rich narrative not through lack of rules, but with one design principle: Compact, Not Crunchy.

### Compact, Not Crunchy

A compact design is not the same as rules-light. The goal is for rules that are unified (rather than piling on subsystems), consistent (few sets of mechanics that can be applied across many situations), and serve as scaffolding for the table’s imagination—not obstacles to it.

#### Emergent Narrative, Not Forced Narrative

Some systems lean on mechanics that directly create story beats such as narrative tokens, or mandatory moves that dictate outcomes. 
These tools can be powerful, but they can also make play feel prescriptive once players are more comfortable improvising.

A compact framework should offer enough rules to give weight and consequence to the dice while getting out of the way of the narrative.

### Credits/inspiration

- Cairn - Amazing cohesive and compact set of rules; Open-source.
- One Ring: Target Numbers - Same feeling of Roll-under (where players always know what they need to roll), but with high numbers
- Nimble: Simplified Combat action economy & rushed attacks
- Legend in the mist: tags can be the main mechanic.
- Daggerheart: attributes (traits), character evolution.

## Setting Design Principles

“History is written by the victors.”

This setting asks: what if the story you grew up hearing was a lie?

Mithryn is a fantasy setting, built around reframing one of fantasy’s most familiar tales from the other side — the so-called “monsters”.

### Principles:

1. Partial Knowledge  
  The characters — and their players — start with limited understanding of this land's past.  
  The GM holds the deeper picture, and part of the experience of the game is gradually uncovering what has been lost, hidden, or deliberately erased.
2. Power and Control  
  Control here is not only military — it is narrative. The conquerors’ greatest victory was not in burning libraries but in convincing the world that there was never anything to burn.  
3. Awakening Atmosphere  
  Even before the deeper truths are uncovered, the setting should feel charged. Players don’t need to know what it is at first; the important thing is that they feel it. As the campaign unfolds, this “awakening” will move from background atmosphere into the heart of the campaign.
