# System Design Principles

## Player-Centered Dice

I believe that players should always know what number they’re aiming for: This empowers informed decisions. Roll-under mechanics achieve this, but can feel alien since in virtually every dice game higher = better.
Target Numbers bridge that gap - They require a pre-calculation when creating the character, but makes the gameplay simple, transparent, and intuitive.

## Swift Resolution

Dice rolls should resolve a situation in a single moment. One roll determines both success and impact: no splitting results into “to hit” and then “damage.” This keeps momentum high and play focused on consequences, not bookkeeping.

## Classless Characters

A character’s role is not dictated by rigid archetypes. Instead, choices, and lived experiences shape their specialties. Players are free to evolve their characters organically, without being locked into a class track.

## Emergent Narrative, Not Forced Narrative

Some systems lean on mechanics that directly create story beats such as narrative tokens, or mandatory moves that dictate outcomes. 
These tools can be powerful, but they can also make play feel prescriptive once players are more comfortable improvising.

The goal is to offer enough rules to support the GM and encapsulate consequence for the dice.


## Credits/inspiration

- Cairn (by Yochai Gal): A free, open-source fantasy RPG that demonstrates how much you can accomplish with a compact set of rules. Its roll-under d20 mechanic keeps resolution simple and unified across situations. Cairn shows how elegance can create freedom, not limitation. This system borrows A LOT from Cairn.

- The One Ring (Free League): Uses Target Numbers in a way that preserves the clarity of roll-under (“I always know what I need to roll”), but with the familiar “roll high” language most players are used to.

- Nimble (by Seth Ronland): A lesser-known but brilliant design where combat avoids slow action economies. Attacks are streamlined, players can push themselves into “rushed” attacks that are weaker but faster or react out of their turn.

- Legend in the Mist (by Jay Dragon): A game that proves that tags can carry both narrative weight and mechanical heft and be the driver of character design.

- Daggerheart (Critical Role / Darrington Press): One of those rare games that makes you rethink assumptions you’ve held for years.
One example is splitting the all-encompassing “Dexterity” into two distinct traits — Agility (movement, jumping, physical daring) and Finesse (sneak, fine hand coordination). It does sound "nothing special", but it has a huge impact on both character design and gameplay, especially in a system without skill lists. This is something I've been tinkering with in old drafts of this system - I figured I wanted something like that but didn't find the right nomenclature.
I also like Daggerheart's use of 2d12, which adds a subtle curve to rolls without overcomplicating the math. Most importantly, Daggerheart bakes character evolution and death into the design: growth comes through play, and death is never just a swing of the dice, but a collaborative decision between player, GM, and table. It encodes the truth that this is a game people play for fun.

# Setting Design Principles

“History is written by the victors.”

This setting asks: what if the story you grew up hearing was a lie?

Mithryn is a fantasy setting, built around reframing one of fantasy’s most familiar tales from the other side — the so-called “monsters”.

## Principles:

1. Partial Knowledge  
  The characters — and their players — start with limited understanding of this land's past.  
  The GM holds the deeper picture, and part of the experience of the game is gradually uncovering what has been lost, hidden, or deliberately erased.
2. Power and Control  
  Control here is not only military — it is narrative. The conquerors’ greatest victory was not in burning libraries but in convincing the world that there was never anything to burn.  
3. Awakening Atmosphere  
  Even before the deeper truths are uncovered, the setting should feel charged. Players don’t need to know what it is at first; the important thing is that they feel it. As the campaign unfolds, this “awakening” will move from background atmosphere into the heart of the campaign.
