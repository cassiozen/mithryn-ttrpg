# Rules

## Ability Scores

Each of the six abilities are used in different circumstances (see Ability Checks, below).

| **Ability**         | **Common Uses**                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agility (AGI)**   | Acrobatics, climbing, balancing, dodging, initiative rolls, escape artist actions.               |
| **Strength (STR)**  | Lifting, pushing/pulling, breaking objects, grappling, shoving, resisting forced movement.                      |
| **Finesse (FIN)**   | Sleight of hand, lockpicking, trap disarming, stealth, delicate tool use.  |
| **Insight (INS)**   | Perception, insight (reading people), detecting lies, tracking, navigation |
| **Presence (PRE)**  | Persuasion, intimidation, deception, performance, leadership, rallying allies, negotiation.                                |
| **Knowledge (KNO)** | Investigation, recall of lore, deciphering languages, identifying creatures or items. |

### Target Numbers (TNs)

Every Ability Score has its own **Target Number (TN)** — the number a player must meet or beat to succeed in a roll for that ability.

**TN formula:**
TN = 20 - Ability Score

## Ability Checks

When a character attempts an action that is risky, dramatic, or challenging, the GM asks for a specific ability check. The player then rolls **2d12** and add or subtract any applicable **Rank bonus/penalty** from Tags/Complications. If the result is **equal to or greater than** that abilitie's TN, the action succeeds.

### Critical Success

If the player rolls **doubles** (both dice showing the same number), it is a **critical success**, regardless of whether the total meets the TN. The action succeeds in a particularly effective or advantageous way, determined by the GM.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes characters have situational benefits or hindrances (environmental effects, clever planning, etc...). At the GM discration, they can ask the players to roll with advantage or disadvantage.

- **Advantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two highest dice before summing.
- **Disadvantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two lowest dice before summing.

## Hit Points and damage tiers

A character's hit points are represented as boxes spread through three tiers: Normal, Wounded and Critical. When the character checks the first box within the Wounded or Critical tiers, they are subject to penalties:

### Wounded — “Badly hurt.”

Effect: Roll all ability checks with disadvantage.

### Critical — “Clinging to Life”

Effects:
Roll all checks with disadvantage.
At the start of each of the PC turns in combat, roll a 1d12. If less than the strengh's score (not the Strengths TR, the Strength ability score), they collapse and become incapacitated until stabilized or healed.

## Healing and Recovery

Hit points can be restored medical attention, potions, magic or rest. Rests can be short or long:

### Short Rest

A short rest represents a pause in the action — a chance to patch wounds and catch a breath.
If the PC is not in the Critical range of hit points, they regain hit points equal to their rank.
A PC in Critical condition can only have their hit points restored through magic/potions or through a long rest.

### Long Rest

A long rest represents uninterrupted sleep, safe shelter, and proper care.
PCs can regain hit points equal to half their Strength score (rounded up).
