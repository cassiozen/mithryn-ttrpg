# Rules

## Ability Scores

Each of the six abilities is used in different circumstances (see Ability Checks, below).

| **Ability** | **Common Uses** |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agility (AGI)** | Acrobatics, climbing, balancing, dodging, initiative rolls, escape artist actions.               |
| **Strength (STR)** | Lifting, pushing/pulling, breaking objects, grappling, shoving, resisting forced movement.                      |
| **Finesse (FIN)** | Sleight of hand, lockpicking, trap disarming, stealth, delicate tool use.  |
| **Insight (INS)** | Perception, insight (reading people), detecting lies, tracking, navigation |
| **Presence (PRE)** | Persuasion, intimidation, deception, performance, leadership, rallying allies, negotiation.                                |
| **Knowledge (KNO)** | Investigation, recall of lore, deciphering languages, identifying creatures or items. |

### Target Numbers (TNs)

Every Ability Score has its own **Target Number (TN)** — the number a player must meet or beat to succeed in a roll for that ability.

**TN formula:**
TN = 20 - Ability Score

## Ability Checks

When a character attempts an action that is risky, dramatic, or challenging, the GM asks for a specific ability check. The player then rolls **2d12** and adds any applicable **Rank bonus** from Tags. If the result is **equal to or greater than** that ability’s TN, the action succeeds.

### Difficulty penalties

When the GM deems some action to be particularly difficult, they can impose a “difficulty penalty”, a number that adds to the TN, making it harder to reach.


### Critical Success

If the player rolls **doubles** (both dice showing the exact same number), it is a **critical success**, regardless of whether the total meets the TN. The action succeeds in a particularly effective or advantageous way, determined by the GM.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes characters have situational benefits or hindrances (environmental effects, clever planning, etc). At the GM discretion, they can ask the players to roll with advantage or disadvantage.

- **Advantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two highest dice before summing.

Example: Michael rolls 3d12 for a 6, 6, and 9: His sum is 15 (9+6). Note that even though Michael had doubles (double 6), they don’t count as a Critical Success because they were not the 2 highest rolls. If Michel had rolled 6, 9, and 9 (double 9s), then it would have counted as a critical success.

- **Disadvantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two lowest dice before summing.

## Tags in Play

Tags are how your character’s unique qualities, skills, or quirks shape the game. When a tag is relevant, it makes a difference mechanically.

### How to Apply a Tag

- Declare It — The player announces that one of their tags applies to the action they’re attempting.
- Judge It — The GM decides whether the tag is a strong and obvious match for the situation. Tags should not stretch to cover everything — they only apply when the fiction makes them clearly relevant.
- Resolve the Roll — If the GM agrees, apply the effect below depending on the type of roll.

#### When a tag applies to an ability check:

- Reduce the Target Number (TN) by your Rank.

This makes success more likely, directly reflecting your character’s specialty.

Example: If your normal TN is 14 and you have Rank 2, using a relevant tag lowers the TN to 12.

#### When a tag applies to an attack roll:

- One of your damage dice automatically counts as a hit.

This represents how your character’s background, training, or knack makes their attack more effective in this particular situation.

Example: A PC with the tag Raised by Sailors is fighting on the deck of a ship. In this setting, the GM rules the tag applies, so one of the player’s weapon dice automatically counts as a hit.

## Hit Points and damage tiers

A character’s hit points are represented as boxes spread through three tiers: Normal, Wounded, and Critical. 
There are two boxes within critical, two within wounded, and two or more within Normal.
When the character checks the first box within the Wounded or Critical tiers, they are subject to penalties:

### Wounded — “Badly hurt.”

Effects: 

Ability Checks: Roll all ability checks with disadvantage.
Combat: You only have one action per turn.

### Critical — “Clinging to Life”

Effects:
Same as wounded
Once a PC enters the Critical tier, roll a strength ability check. If they fail, they collapse and become incapacitated until stabilized or healed.

## Healing and Recovery

Hit points can be restored with medical attention, potions, magic, or rest. Rests can be short or long:

### Short Rest

A short rest represents a pause in the action — a chance to patch wounds and catch a breath.
If the PC is not in the Critical range of hit points, they regain hit points equal to their Rank + 1d4.
A PC in Critical condition can only have their hit points restored through magic/potions or through a long rest.

### Long Rest

A long rest represents uninterrupted sleep, safe shelter, and proper care.
PCs roll Rank + 3D4 to determine how many hit points they recover.


## Character Death

This game is not about punishing players with random, meaningless death. It’s about telling stories together. When a character is brought to 0 hit points, the player chooses (together with the GM) what happens next. The goal is always the same: keep the story fun, dramatic, and engaging for everyone.

### Option 1 — Death

The character’s story ends here.
The Player Creates a New Character: The new character begins at the same Level as the one who died. They join the game immediately — the GM and players work together to weave them into the ongoing story.

### Option 2 — Defining Scar

The character survives, but they are forever changed.

A Lasting Complication: The player and GM work together to create a new complication tag that represents the trauma of nearly dying. This is written on the character sheet just like any other complication.

Mechanical Impact: From now on, that complication can be invoked by the GM in appropriate moments, just like other complications — raising TNs, hindering attacks, or introducing story twists.

Timing: The complication does not need to be written immediately in the heat of gameplay. At the GM’s discretion, the player can take time to reflect and finalize the scar — but it should be completed by the start of the next session or story chapter.

#### What Makes a Good Scar?

A good scar is more than a wound — it’s something that lingers in the fiction and keeps generating interesting play. It should:

- Have Narrative Teeth: It should change how the world interacts with the character or how the character moves through the world.
- Be Specific, Not Vague: “Haunted by Fire” is better than “Afraid.” The best scars recall the moment of near-death.
- Be Double-Edged: A scar should create tension or challenge, but not make the character unplayable. The fun is in navigating the new flaw, not in removing the player from the action.

#### Examples of Scars

- Burned by the Sorcerer’s Fire — Skin marred, crowds whisper, enemies exploit the weakness.
- Nightmares of the River Witch — Dreams bleed into waking life, making rest uneasy.
- Lame Leg from the Ogre’s Blow — Slower to climb and run; yet a constant reminder of survival.
- Sworn Never to Abandon a Friend Again — A vow that will drag you into danger.
- Distrustful of Healers — Refuses aid too long, even when badly hurt.
