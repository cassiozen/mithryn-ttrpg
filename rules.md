# Rules

## Ability Scores

Each of the six abilities are used in different circumstances (see Ability Checks, below).

| **Ability**         | **Common Uses**                                                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agility (AGI)**   | Acrobatics, climbing, balancing, dodging, initiative rolls, escape artist actions.               |
| **Strength (STR)**  | Lifting, pushing/pulling, breaking objects, grappling, shoving, resisting forced movement.                      |
| **Finesse (FIN)**   | Sleight of hand, lockpicking, trap disarming, stealth, delicate tool use.  |
| **Insight (INS)**   | Perception, insight (reading people), detecting lies, tracking, navigation |
| **Presence (PRE)**  | Persuasion, intimidation, deception, performance, leadership, rallying allies, negotiation.                                |
| **Knowledge (KNO)** | Investigation, recall of lore, deciphering languages, identifying creatures or items. |

### Target Numbers (TNs)

Every Ability Score has its own **Target Number (TN)** — the number a player must meet or beat to succeed in a roll for that ability.

**TN formula:**
TN = 20 - Ability Score

## Ability Checks

When a character attempts an action that is risky, dramatic, or challenging, the GM asks for a specific ability check. The player then rolls **2d12** and adds any applicable **Rank bonus** from Tags. If the result is **equal to or greater than** that abilitie's TN, the action succeeds.

### Dificulty penalties

When the GM deem some action to be particularly difficult, they can impose a "difficulty penalty", a number that adds to the TN, making it harder to reach.


### Critical Success

If the player rolls **doubles** (both dice showing the same number), it is a **critical success**, regardless of whether the total meets the TN. The action succeeds in a particularly effective or advantageous way, determined by the GM.

### Advantage and Disadvantage

Sometimes characters have situational benefits or hindrances (environmental effects, clever planning, etc...). At the GM discration, they can ask the players to roll with advantage or disadvantage.

- **Advantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two highest dice before summing.

Example: Michael rolls 3d12 for a 6, 6 and 9: His sum is 15 (9+6). Note that even though Michael had doubles (double 6), they don't count as a Critical Success because they were not the 2 highest rolls. If Michel had rolled 6, 9 and 9 (double 9s) then it would have counted as a critical success.

- **Disadvantage:** Roll **3d12** and take the two lowest dice before summing.

## Hit Points and damage tiers

A character's hit points are represented as boxes spread through three tiers: Normal, Wounded and Critical. 
There are two boxes within critical, two within wounded, and two or more on Normal.
When the character checks the first box within the Wounded or Critical tiers, they are subject to penalties:

### Wounded — “Badly hurt.”

Effects: 

Ability Checks: Roll all ability checks with disadvantage.
Combat: You only have one action per turn.

### Critical — “Clinging to Life”

Effects:
Same as wounded
At the start of each of the PC turns in combat, roll a a strength ability check. If fail, they collapse and become incapacitated until stabilized or healed.

## Healing and Recovery

Hit points can be restored medical attention, potions, magic or rest. Rests can be short or long:

### Short Rest

A short rest represents a pause in the action — a chance to patch wounds and catch a breath.
If the PC is not in the Critical range of hit points, they regain hit points equal to their Rank + 1d4.
A PC in Critical condition can only have their hit points restored through magic/potions or through a long rest.

### Long Rest

A long rest represents uninterrupted sleep, safe shelter, and proper care.
PCs roll Rank + 3D4 to determine how many hit points they recover.
