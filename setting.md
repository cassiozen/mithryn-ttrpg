# Sandbox fantasy TTRPG Campaign

## Setting

The land of Mithryn rises on a plateau ringed by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, a fire-mountain long fallen quiet. Ask the scribes of distant courts and they will tell you the story is plain: once, an evil, tyrant king ruled here. In the first year of this era, the High Council brought their armies, toppled his rule, and delivered freedom.

That is the tale the world accepts. A simple story. A closed book.

Yet life in Mithryn has never tasted of freedom. For generations, our roads have been watched, the markets searched, the wrong word punished. Most folk keep their heads down and their voices low.

The world looked away, told there was nothing here to see: Mithryn was a plateau of poor soil and poorer fortunes,  notable only for the evil it once harbored.

But the plateau whispers otherwise.

The people themselves carry that mystery. Elsewhere, bloodlines are guarded and categorized — dwarf and elf, man and halfling. Here such words mean little. It's in the faces that pass on the street: Eyes shaped like no two others. Ears that taper subtly or curl in curious arcs. Skin runs the full span from the palest white to the deepest black, and then further into undertones and hues: bronze, copper, rose, the greens of olive and soft moss.
No one is entirely one thing, yet each bears a look that marks them as from this plateau.

And then there are the things that shouldn’t exist, yet sometimes do.

A shard of pottery with a painting and glaze unlike anything made today. A fragment of fabric that seems to shimmer in ways dye cannot explain... Such items are rare — and dangerous. The law demands they be surrendered; to keep one is a capital crime. Yet they are hidden — in false walls, beneath floorboards, inside bread ovens gone cold. Because everyone feels it: they are pieces of something greater, something that does not match the story we’ve been told.

Nearly three millennia have passed since the Council’s war. The world no longer spares Mithryn a thought: their soldiers no longer march here; their interest in this place has waned.

And in that quiet, something has begun to stir.

It is not spoken of, yet it is everywhere — It shows in the songs hummed on the walk home that no one quite remembers learning. In the sudden warmth of the sun breaking through a long grey sky. In the feeling that the air itself carries a promise.
No one names it, but all can feel it. Something is awakening.
And with it, hope.

## The tale of the people of Mithryn

This section is for the GM only, it contains spoilers - proceed with caution.

“History is written by the victors”

The setting in this game is a reimagining of one of fantasy’s most enduring tales — but from the perspective of the conquered peoples of the east, long branded as monsters by their enemies.

As GM, you might want to conceal the full truth at first (Players already start with only fragments of Mithryn's history), then lead them to gradually figure it out. When the moment comes, or if you notice they are already suspecting, a casual name drop can make the revelation strike with tremendous weight.

## The secrets of Mithryn

There was a time when Mithryn was the beating heart of the known world. Standing on a high plateau surrounded by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, the sleeping fire-mountain whose soil was richer than any valley. 
Imposible terraces climbed the mountain’s sides — not gentle, pastoral gardens, but soaring vertical orchards and hanging fields in sheer defiance of gravity, overflowing with fruit, vegetables, and grain. The fruit grown here was famed for its sweetness; vegetables, herbs, and grains were prized across the lands.

Within the city walls, light from crystalline lamps spilled into broad plazas where orators debated beneath flowering trees.

Magic was not hoarded in hidden towers, nor knowledge locked behind guarded gates. Spellwrights sat alongside carpenters in the tea houses, trading charms for better chisels. The universities welcomed anyone with questions to ask. Here, science and magic danced together like lifelong friends.

Mithryn was a land of many peoples, bound not by conquest but by choice. Orcs, halflings, dwarves, elves, men — they wove their bloodlines and cultures into something richer than any one heritage could hold. A living tapestry of union and change.

And then came the silencing.

Clad in humility and speaking the language of caution, the wizard Tharuk-Un (the Grey Vulture) whispered to kings and high lords beyond the plateau. He told them change was dangerous, that the pace of Mithryn’s progress was a threat to the old balances. If left unchecked, it might spread and consume all tradition. Through his counsel, alliances shifted in shadow. The day came when the armies of distant realms — Elves in bright mail, Men bearing the crests of old kingdoms — marched on the city.

This is the truth beneath the lie the players begin with. The plateau is not poor; its air is not empty. The bloodlines, the strange relics, the half-remembered songs — all are echoes of Mithryn’s forgotten brilliance.

### The Amulet

In the final months before the siege, when King Nairon could no longer work around the storm gathering beyond the plateau, he called together the finest minds of Mithryn for one last great work. Not a weapon of war — for Mithryn had never believed in such solutions — but a seed of preservation that could not burn.

They conceived something unprecedented: an amulet that would be both vessel and key, library and teacher, memory and promise.
Every master in the city contributed. The scholars etched microscopic runes that held entire treatises. Earthsingers hummed their growth-songs into the metal until it thrummed with life. Astronomers captured the mathematics of the stars in its golden band. Even children were brought to touch it, so it would remember what wonder felt like before the world taught them fear.

The amulet is a knowledge vault. A seed that holds the potential to transform the world anew.

### The fall

The King of Mithryn fell; the libraries burned. Towers that had taken lifetimes to build toppled in hours. What remained, the conquerors claimed for themselves.

But the amulet survived. When it was torn from King Nairon’s hand, the one who took it was struck with a sudden, shattering realization. Something within the amulet opened the truth of Mithryn to them. In that moment, they turned away from destruction and hid it, sparing it from those who would seek to use or destroy it.

Centuries became millennia. The conquerors’ version of history hardened into stone: Mithryn was a fortress, its king a tyrant, its defeat a liberation. The true story was buried, outlawed, forgotten.
Yet the amulet endures, and it stirs. It has waited three thousand years. It wants to be found.

## The real power of the amulet

The amulet is a vault that contains the knowledge that made Mythyr and its people prosper. Layer upon layer of possibilities that could reshape the world:

It holds practical memories — how to terrace a mountain so it feeds thousands, the way to shape wood, clay and steel with thought and skill until it becomes poetry. Such knowledge alone could restore Mithryn's material prosperity.

Deeper, it contains the secrets of the social architecture — the contracts and rituals of trust that let orcs, men, dwarves, halflings and elves choose cooperation over conquest. These memories could unravel three thousand years of carefully cultivated division.

At its heart, the amulet guards the most luminous truth: that magic belongs to everyone. Not as a platitude, but as practical knowledge — the specific words, gestures, and mindsets that awaken the dormant spark in any person. A farmer could learn to sing to crops so they grow healthier and stronger. A carpenter could discover the runes that make wood stronger than steel. The amulet doesn't grant power; it reminds people they always had it.

To Tharuk-Un, the Grey Vulture, the amulet represents unmaking: a key that would open every locked door he keeps, a voice that would teach every tongue the words he forbids. He hunts it without rest and will do everything in his power to destroy it.

## Adventure hook: The Chains of the Grey Vulture


Trahald is a halfling with many layers: To most people, he's nothing more than a traveling merchant.
He’s the sort who blends into a crowd, quick with a joke, slow to anger.
To the party, he’s more than that: a smuggler with a knack for slipping past watchtowers and patrols, a friend who has traded favors, shared drinks, and pulled them out of tight corners. That’s the layer they know best — the resourceful rogue who always has an escape plan.
But beneath that grin and swagger lies a quiet but unwavering loyalty to Mithryn. He risks himself to preserve scraps of its lost culture — an outlawed song carried in his memory, a carved tile tucked into his pack, a forbidden book hidden in a crate of spices. He’s not part of any organization — there is no organization — just a scattered web of people who sometimes hear of each other’s deeds second- or third-hand. For Trahald, each smuggled relic or remembered verse is a defiance against the Silencing.


### The Trouble

On his latest run north, Trahald played the part of the merchant again, bound for the elven markets. 

Trahald had been trading in the borderlands when he met Milo Burrows, a fellow halfling traveler with a reputation for tall tales and improbable luck.

Milo told him what he was after: “There’s an old tunnel in the high mist-cloaked mountains, untouched since before the Silencing. The old songs call it a thieves’ road. Rumor says there’s treasure up there from the Kings of Mithryn themselves.”

Together, they reached the ruins in the mountains — cold, wet caverns where the air tasted of stone dust and history.



At this point, Milo betrayed Trahald. I big hit knocked him unconscious. When he woke up and managed to find his way out, he found all their supplies and ponnies gone.



In his rush to return south, Trahald was injured — a tumble down a rocky gully or a wolf’s bite (you can choose), forcing him to rest near an elven patrol route. That’s when the soldiers found him. They saw only a smuggler far from home with suspicious goods.


### Current Situation

Trahald now sits in Thalan Caras, a prison woven into the roots of massive trees, awaiting transfer to a more secure location. The elves have beaten him for information about smuggling routes, unaware that he carries knowledge that could alter the fate of nations. To them, he’s just another petty criminal with no greater importance.




## Locations:

### Thalan Caras — The Root Prison
Location & Appearance
Setting: Deep in the northern elven forests, built where several colossal trees grow so close their root systems have fused into a natural fortress.
Architecture: The prison is not “built” in the human sense. Its cells are hollowed from the living roots themselves, shaped and hardened by druidic magic so they remain alive and unyielding. The wood heals if cut, and only elven magic or immense force can open a sealed door.
Light & Atmosphere: Dim light filters down from the canopy through moss-choked slits. In the prison’s depths, bioluminescent fungi provide eerie green-blue illumination. The air smells of earth, sap, and damp moss.
Symbolism: To the elves, the place represents justice intertwined with the living forest. To prisoners, it is a place where the roots grow around you — and will never let go.
Access to Thalan Caras
There is no single “main entrance,” and each approach has its own risks.
The Forest Road (Official Route)
A narrow, patrolled road leading to the front gates.
Challenges: Checkpoints every 200–300 paces, mounted scouts, and magical warding to detect concealed weapons or artifacts.
The River of Sighs (Smuggler’s Route)
A slow, winding river that disappears beneath the roots before surfacing within the prison’s lower cisterns.
Challenges: Treacherous currents, waterlogged roots blocking the way, giant freshwater eels, risk of drowning.
The Canopy Path (Elven Messenger Route)
A high rope-and-branch walkway connecting outposts above the prison.
Challenges: Requires climbing skill, extreme heights, and avoiding hawk-riders and sentries who patrol from above.
The Hollowed Root Tunnel (Forgotten Entrance)
An overgrown tunnel leading to a collapsed section of an old root cell.
Challenges: Collapsed debris, swarms of biting insects, and a druidic seal that may require puzzle-solving, magical insight, or brute force to bypass.
Potential Challenges Before They Even Reach It
Territorial Beasts: The elven forest is home to predators — giant owls, moss wolves, and territorial treants.
Wandering Patrols: Mobile elven scouts may notice outsiders and tail them for hours before acting.
Natural Hazards: Chasms hidden under moss, quickmire (bog that looks like solid ground), or poisonous plants.
Elven Bureaucracy: If they try a legal approach (petitioning for Trahald’s release), they’ll have to navigate elven law, diplomacy, and bribes — all while avoiding giving away the real reason they want him.
Inside Thalan Caras
Cell Layout: Trahald is kept in a mid-level cell, away from both the damp lower cells (used for the most dangerous criminals) and the “honor cells” near the surface (used for political prisoners of status).
Security:
Living root bars (flexible enough for elves to open via magic, rigid to all others).
Guards in rotating pairs; no one stays at one post for more than two hours.
Silent Alarm magic woven into the roots — breaking or damaging a root anywhere in the prison alerts the warden.
NPCs:
Warden Lathandriel — A strict but pragmatic elf who may be bribed with rare books or cultural relics.
Other Prisoners — A human bard jailed for forbidden songs, an orc merchant accused of spying, a deserter from the elven army. These can be allies, distractions, or complications.
Possible Rescue Paths
The Disguised Official: Forge documents, bribe an official, or charm their way in as inspectors or dignitaries — risky if papers are checked against magical archives.
The Smuggler’s Flood: Sneak in via the River of Sighs, free Trahald, and ride the current out — possibly flooding part of the prison as a distraction.
The Inside Job: Get another prisoner released or transferred, who then carries hidden tools or information back inside for the rescue attempt.
The Distraction: Stage a large enough disturbance in the forest (set a fire, lure a monster, instigate a prisoner riot) to draw guards away.
The Bribe: Find what Warden Lathandriel wants most and trade it for Trahald’s freedom — but at the cost of losing a valuable cultural relic or political favor.
The Ambush: Intercept the transfer caravan on the road when Trahald is moved to the high-security facility — avoiding the prison altogether.



### Veyrath Crossing, A bustling border city just outside the occupied zone, rebuilt on the ruins of a small pre-war trade town.

- Name origin: derived from “Veyra,” an old Mordor word meaning “to endure,” and “Crossing” because it straddles the only safe pass out of the occupied zone.
- Purpose: Serves as the campaign’s first “hub” — neutral-enough territory that agents, mercenaries, traders, and spies from all factions mix here.
- Appearance: Built along both sides of a deep river gorge, connected by a massive stone bridge of pre-war design (rumored to be dwarven-engineered with Mordor’s science-magics).  
Old architecture shows your people’s precision stonework, but patched with haphazard wood-and-mud extensions from post-war refugees.  

- Tone & Atmosphere: On the surface, it’s bustling and mercantile — traders hawk goods, ferries move people across the river, guards stroll the bridge.
Beneath the surface, there’s an underbelly of political dissent:
Tavern back rooms where old veterans tell stories of the city before it fell.
Smugglers running contraband past enemy patrols.
Scholars collecting scraps of pre-war knowledge.
The anti-Tharuk-Unrhetoric here is cautious:
Not shouted in the square, but over mugs of bitter beer with the shutters closed.
Locals call him “the Grey Vulture” or “Fire-Monger”

#### Rumors and conversations:

True
“Caravans keep vanishing on the Old Forest Road — some say the trees themselves are taking them.”
→ Leads to Great Forest quest (Hook A).
“A river merchant named Iarwain is paying in silver gearwork trinkets for escorts upriver.”
→ Leads to River-Keeper Valley quest (Hook B).
“An old artificer’s been locked up in Imlaril’s tower — the mountain elves say he’s ‘dangerous.’”
→ Leads to Silver Haven quest (Hook C).

Partially True
“Incanus himself was seen on the bridge two nights ago.”
→ Actually an agent wearing a grey cloak, sent to stir fear.
“The Grey Vulture’s searching for a ‘fire jewel’ to crown his staff.”
→ The amulet isn’t a staff ornament, but this rumor plants suspicion.
“The Great Forest is safe now — a caravan came through last week without incident.”
→ That caravan bribed the elves; still dangerous for anyone else.
“Someone in the Archive of Ashes is hiding a pre-war map of the city.”
→ True, but it’s incomplete and possibly booby-trapped with protective runes.


#### Hooks:

Hook A: The Vanishing Caravans
Destination: The Great Forest (Mirkwood).
In-universe premise: Merchants complain that caravans of goods and refugees keep disappearing when taking the old forest road. The missing goods were bound for rebel enclaves in the north.
Tolkien tie-in: Leads to Mirkwood, spider encounters, and the shrine depicting the amulet as a relic of control.

Hook B: The Odd River Merchant
Destination: River-Keeper valley (Tom Bombadil).
In-universe premise: A colorful merchant is looking for armed escorts upriver to his “little patch of paradise.” He claims he can’t pay in coin, but has “something older and truer” that might interest scholars.
Tolkien tie-in: Leads to Tom Bombadil reimagined; the “something older” is a gear-map fragment pointing toward other leads.

Hook C: The Sealed Workshop
Destination: Silver Haven (Rivendell).
In-universe premise: A contact says a master artisan — possibly the last who knows your people’s alloy-forging secrets — is imprisoned in a mountain fortress.
Tolkien tie-in: Infiltration into Rivendell reimagined; discovery of stolen Mordor tech.
