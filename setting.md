# Setting

The land of Mithryn rises on a plateau ringed by the slopes of Mount Amaroth, a fire-mountain long fallen quiet. Ask the scribes of distant courts and they will tell you the story is plain: once, an evil, tyrant king ruled here. In the first year of this era, the High Council brought their armies, toppled his rule, and delivered freedom.

That is the tale the world accepts. A simple story. A closed book.

Yet life in Mithryn has never tasted of freedom. For generations, our roads have been watched, the markets searched, the wrong word punished. Most folk keep their heads down and their voices low.

The world looked away, told there was nothing here to see: Mithryn was a plateau of poor soil and poorer fortunes,  notable only for the evil it once harbored.

But the plateau whispers otherwise.

The people themselves carry that mystery. Elsewhere, bloodlines are guarded and categorized — dwarf and elf, man and halfling. Here such words mean little. It's in the faces that pass on the street: Eyes shaped like no two others. Ears that taper subtly or curl in curious arcs. Skin runs the full span from the palest white to the deepest black, and then further into undertones and hues: bronze, copper, rose, the greens of olive and soft moss.
No one is entirely one thing, yet each bears a look that marks them as from this plateau.

And then there are the things that shouldn’t exist, yet sometimes do.

A shard of pottery with a painting and glaze unlike anything made today. A fragment of fabric that seems to shimmer in ways dye cannot explain... Such items are rare — and dangerous. The law demands they be surrendered; to keep one is a capital crime. Yet they are hidden — in false walls, beneath floorboards, inside bread ovens gone cold. Because everyone feels it: they are pieces of something greater, something that does not match the story we’ve been told.

Nearly three millennia have passed since the Council’s war. The world no longer spares Mithryn a thought: their soldiers no longer march here; their interest in this place has waned.

And in that quiet, something has begun to stir.

It is not spoken of, yet it is everywhere — It shows in the songs hummed on the walk home that no one quite remembers learning. In the sudden warmth of the sun breaking through a long grey sky. In the feeling that the air itself carries a promise.
No one names it, but all can feel it. Something is awakening.
And with it, hope.
